### 2024-08-02 17-05 - the air conditiner

this is a new document that I started when I was stoned a few days ago, but the next day when I woke up, I couldn't remember what I was going to write in it. anyway, I woke up this afternoon thinking about all of the stuff that I wrote about while I was stoned where I was describing the [macro-view of how the earth](/dear-remi.md#2024-07-28-0253---i-figured-it-out) and how a new saturnian-system gets created when the crust of the earth gets kicked off and goes to another solar-system. I wanted to expound on that idea when I woke up and "talk it through" (like I do with blahblog) but with this document, I'm not intending to talk through my situaton, but instead how I think things work. HOWEVER, when I woke up, there's this loud waterfall sound going on behind me because (according to greg) the air conditioner's pipes have frozen up, and no coolant is flowing. I'll come back to the saturn thing at a later tim5 -- I was thinking to start out with the air conditioner though, because greg's story of what's happening doesn't add up.
when I woke up, I was comparing the concept of greg's story (my understanding of it) and the way that I was feeling the unit: I went to sleep at about noon and the air conditioner was running all night (for some reason I decided to watch [a video about a nasa engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUkbdqw9pBk) and [a video about electric motors in bacteria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5uVsmMsiEA) instead of sleeping, and the videos I watched right before also kinda put me into a bit of a problem-solving mindset). the way that heat pumps is described well on youtube [TODO link to technology connections video] and basically the process uses different gas/liquid phase changes of a coolant (old ones used amonia/NH3 to do it -- which is a very interesting chemical, which I'd like to talk about in the future -- cause it's pretty interesting -- it's like methane (a hydrocarbon), but the hydrogens are cOnnected to a nitrogen instead of a carbon -- which, I think allows it to be better compressed (like methane compared to kerosine)) -- anyway, so the main thing about the system is that I want to get the coolant to boil in the unit and then recondense outside. the idea there on that one is that the lower boiling/condensing point allows me to "pump" the heat into a diffrent place by adjusting where the coolant boils and condenses (ie so if I want the heat to go outside like an AC, then I have it condense inside, "pulling" the heat into the coolant when it returns to liquid state).
so my insight into this system when I woke up is that our AC is being *too efficient* -- and the reason why I think that happens (especially when I'm asleep) is because of my theory about how phase changes work: when water evaporates, there's something coming out of the ground (hydrogen/prana) energy, that's going to cause the water to begin to vibrate similar enough to it (the perceptible frequencies are in IR/heat), and when the hydrogens of the water starts to vibrate with enough frequency/magnitude, the hyrogens will separate from the oxygens and they'll both out into the atmosphere.
now, another thing to note is that our airconditoner also is really good at pulling the hydrogens/chi/prana energy out of my room (probably so my concepts don't become too intense), and I think what's happening is that my concepts are getting condensed into the coolant (which is just a hydrogen transferring liquid) -- which is all really good, but I think my room's concepts are a bit more higher energy than normal (ie, the hydrogen/heat is vibrating on more frequencies than just IR), and so -- when it gets to the AC unit outside, when the AC is supposed to expand/evaporate the coolant, the extra energy from me and my concepts that are being pulled off of my body while sleeping
	when I used to star-watch, a similar thing is happening, but I (the star-watcher) am acting basically like a heat/hydrogen pump from the star to the earth -- because my eyes looking into the star are causing my to begin to vibrate like the star does -- and I viscerally feel the environment/ground heating up around me when I'm in a good flow. I'm basically pulling in toward myself a whole lot of earth's hydrogen/heat that is similar in vibration to the sun I'm looking it. this inward pull of heat/hydrogen will cause a lot of evaporation around me as the water in m/ body and around me is going to start vibrating similarly (another thing I noticed while star-watching is that water evaporates around me really really quickly).
and that gives the heat/hydrogen that's coming from my room a much higher transfer efficiency to it (cause it has more vibration), so when it freezes, it'll freeze more intensely (making ice crystals, not vitreous freezing where no crystals are formed because of low intensity vibration). now, when I went outside to look at the unit, I noticed a section of the return pipe which isn't insulated at all (it's open to the outdoor solar heat) -- and that's almost certainly causing an interaction there because, let's just stay for example that when the coolant recondenses, it's condensing into a very cold liquid ice (no crystals) cause of the higher frequency -- but then when it gets to the uninsulated section of pipe, that vitreous ice will not start getting modified by the heat from outdoors, and that not-smoothe frequency interaction will be just enough of a rough edge for ice crystals to start forming in the pipe.
	btw, I believe that these phase changes are energy positive (not really cause the energy comes from the sun), and each time one of these phase changes happens, it's converting a little bit of the radiant/solar energy into the IR frequency range. so, if someone were to chain up a bunch of these heat/hydrogen pumps together, it'd probably give "free" energy (it comes from the sun). come to think of it, that's probably why coolant is such a heavily controlled substance (has nothing to do with it's insulating power as a "greenhouse gas" -- holding more heat into the earth -- because again, the heat of the earth is just it's attraction to hydrogens that are vibrating near to its own -- which means that, just like the body, its temperature is regulated by its attraction)
		one of the weird things that happens to me, is that I don't get hot like others do on hot days, and also the AC unit down here in the basement causes me to have the "bone chilling" (inside-out) cold all of the time -- and when I go outside on a really hot day, because my body isn't attractive to a lot of other people's vibrations, I don't attract their hydrogen/heat like others do, and so I don't really get very hot. also I noticed too that it feels cool to me on a hot day, unitl someone else shows up, and when I get into their aura, then suddenly I start to feel heat (cause I start vibrating similar to them) -- and when they go away, I also return back to feeling not hot again. it seems that the cold in my body (the "bone chilling" cold) is coming from the inside and radiating outwards -- so I'm actually causing the environment all around me to gain a similar heat/vibration as my own.
so I guess the solution for this AC problem is probably to better insulate the pipe outside.
