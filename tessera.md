hi, I'd like to use your program to demonstrate the transition between platonic solids. the illustration would go something like this:
1. start with a tetrahedron, such that it's not pointing upward (like how it's normally seen), but with its two edges opposite to each other forming a cross (to visualise this, imagine I'm looking from the top looking down: one edge will go horizontally left-to-right, then just above or below that is another edge that goes top-to-bottom. connected to each of these two edges are two triangles, which swing up (or down) to meet the end of the above (or below) edge -- not sure if that makes sense). (TH standing on it's edge?)
2. the points of the TH will be selected, and then they will be pushed inward to form planes (this is effectively the same as trucating or [rectifying the tetrahedron](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/962240), but the visual of them being pushed, is because it's designed to show the platonic solids being creating from a contracting or constraining force). once the points have been pushed in such that all of the planes meet each other, it should form an octahedron.
3. again we're going to take the octahedron now and push it's points inward until the planes meet, and a cube should be formed. (in each one of these transitions, I want to show how the new shape is positioned at a slightly offset angle from the original shape).
	- the cube and octahedron are duals of each other -- and I can't do it in my head, but I believe that if the cube's points are pushed inwards again, it'll form an octahedron again. that'd be cool to show that not only are they duals, but they can be made from each other by continual contraction (pushing their verticies till they become planes).
4. with the cube, now we're going to do something different: this time, we're going to push the edges inward, forming a plane, and when the planes meet, this will now be a dodecahedron.
5. again the icosahedron can be created from the dodecahedron by pushing the points inward till they become planes.
	- (it's really hard for me to do this stuff in my head) for this trasformation, it appears different than the cube <-> octahedron one because the planes don't really "meet" in the same way, but kinda stop when they hit the vertex (effectively the same as drawing the triangle around any of the points on the dodecahedron and chopping it there). this is probably significant.
6. now, there are *three* duals which transform one to another,  each by pushing the points inward (TH and itself, HH <-> OH, DH <-> IH). then, there's *two* transformation from one  solid to another (push TH *points* into OH (irreversible?), and push cube's *edges* into DH).
- TH and itself, each time (half?) the size of the former, and upside-down.
- the HH <-> OH is turned (by 45(degrees)? -- not sure).
- the DH <-> IH are also turned a bit as well.
- I'm not sure the size/volume diffrences, between these solid but it seems it would be interesting to know that. 
7. I find the two contractive transformations of edges and points to be really interesting, because it's paired with three duals: same but an octave bigger (TH), different going from traingles (3) to squares (4) (HH <-> OH), and then harmonius expansive/contractive (DH <-> IH).
- oscillating between these duals gives me three different feelings:
	- the TH is always double or half (relating to octaves and binary), and because the double or half is pointing the opposite direction, it's like a direct ricochet (180(degrees) reflection)
	- the HH <-> OH transformation is both extremely pointy and sudden. the angles also arrive at 45(degrees from each other), so feels like a very hard ricochet, which gives me the sense of these two being very diffreent from each other. also, the OH looks much more like a sphere than a cube does even though the cube has more points than a sphere. I'm not sure how to capture the feeling of that difference between these two visually though.
		- in traditianl teaching, the difference is between air and earth, which are quite different -- but I don't think that's an effective way of showing the difference -- because air is invisible and earth is visible. these are both visible, so the difference has to be seen in their angles. they're like complete opposites, wheras the IH <-> DH one has much more similarity, and so is therefore more harmonius.
	- the DH <-> IH shows expansion/contraction because the DH's pentagrams become IH's domes, and it feels very smooth, as it's a very slight ricochet (not sure the angle, but much less than 180 or 45). these as water/ether make the calm feeling that happens at the ocean and stuff like that.

ignore all of my extra commentary about their properties at the end there :) each shape produces a strong feeling for me. anyway, next I'd like to show the platonic solids as an expansive transformation, but I haven't figured those ones out yet. I'll explain more later, and maybe you have some ideas.

---------------

the next visualisation I have in mind is not at all related to this program at all -- and can be considered an entirely different project (something more like an abstract modeling discovery program, sorta like geogebra in 3d). to give an example, I'll explain the thing I want to visualise:
1. start with a tetrahedron pointing upward. select the top point and split the vertex into 3 (one for each face).
2. now, we're going to open the TH like a flower. once it's been opened all the way (the vertices align with the plane of the bottom triagle), the it'll now be 4 triagles, forming an equitlateral triangle twice the size and pointing the opposite direction as the bottom of the original TH.
3. I want to be able to now select the edges of the large triangle now, and use that edge length to add that line length on to the 3 verticies of the large triagle as lines. then I want to be able to move them so that they come together, making a new tetrahedron which is (twice?) the size as the original one that was opened. the point at the top of the new tetrahedron is going to be important, because now I want to make the chestahedron.
4. I will now close up the original tetrahedron some of the way, so to do that, I'll put it so it's open about halfway. now, I want to make the three quadrilaterals; I'll do that by selecting the top point of the large tetrahedron, and two of the verticies of the partially open smaller tetrahedron, and then finally the vertex between the petals. this will form a quadrilateral that appears like a kite.
5. as I open the petals of the small tetrrahedron, there's a point where the suface area of the petals (triangles) are now going to equal the surface area of the kites. I want to find that position. at that position the kites will also have the same angle as the legs of a star, ie, as if I were two "stellate a pentagon" or make a pentagram. I want to be able to show that, as well.

another visualisation that would be really cool, would be to be able to take a cube and then turn it so that it's pointing upward (one point up, one point down, and 6 around it). sure it's easy to put the plane at half of the root-3 diagonal, but I want to be able to use calculations in this program to find thing, so I want to be able to have all of the line intersections that the plane makes with the cube able to be measured, and to find out when all of the line lengths are the same.

the whole idea of this program is to be able to do something like geogebra does where I can build up lines and angles using abstract definitions and relations (a line perpendicular to something), but that I can also use those 2d lines and angles and things as properties for 3d things (such as the line length of the big triangle making the edge length of the new tetrahedron). I want to be able to take the circles and their intersections, (like the vesica, and show that the line length between that vesica is also the same as the one in the diagonal of the cube). in frank's book, he talks about a second hegagon being in the chestahedron -- and I believe him, but I can't seem to find it. I want tools to be able to look for it and also be able to build asymmetrical polyhedra from it.
	another example of this will be also in his book, there's a drawing that looks something like a steering wheel. normally, I would assume that it's a variation of the trinity symbol (venn diagram), but it's not: the three parts of the steering wheel don't intersect at where the three trintiy petals join; they're offset a little bit, and that offset seems to be important, because out of it, he's drawing a 7-petaled flower. it seems to be connected to his "trinity form" -- and seems (from what I'm seeing) to have a lot of other assymetrical shapes in it. I want to figure it out.

--------

another example of a visualisation would be to again, open the tetrahedron (just as before), but instead of opening it all the way up, this time I'm going to set an icosahedron so that its triagle matches the tetrahedron, and only open it up so that the other three triagles fit exactly where the triangles of the icosahedron are. from there, I want to stellate that one and make this other form that he shows (where you can put 4 of them together and it'll make a chestahedron, minus the exact shape of the original TH in the middle of the four). that one really interests me.
