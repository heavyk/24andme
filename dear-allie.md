### 2024-05-28 01:31 - a small guide

hi allie. after I saw jou guys yesterday, I stayed around to pull the clover weeds in the front on the side. next to them, is often times where some mushrooms grow. as I was pulling the clover weeds, I noticed a few dried mushrooms next to them; so, I ate them. then later when I was getting up to go get a drink of water at my house, I noticed a whole bunch of dried mushrooms on the grass 20-30 or so; I ate them too. it took me a bit to eat them all, and when I was done, I noticed that I could already start to feel the mushrooms (after only 5m or so). it's not normal that they come up so quickly, so I decided that was enough for the day and was going to head home. I got home and sat in the garage chair for the entire time since I left up until the sun was had set (so at least an hour). during the time, I kept phasing in and out of reality (kinda like sleeping but more like gaining and losing consciousness, like if someone hit me really hard in the head, and it's too difficult to keep my consciousness still looking out of my eyes). I finally arrived to enough consciousness that I went straight to bed. I woke up at around 23:00, and the thought that I had (sorry, I told you that whole mushroom story to tell you that during it, I had the idea to eat weed -- but I didn't want to because I was so tired, so I went to sleep). anyway, upon waking up, some of the first thoughts in my head (I don't remember the very first ones -- oh yeah, I think they were about you cause I dreamed about you) were to go and eat weed. I figured it was around 4am during the time, so I jumped up to try and get everything ready so I could eat at 04:20 -- but I was surprised to find out that it was still 05-27, and not yet my birthday, so I decided I would wait a few hours.
while I was waiting, an idea popped into my head: OK, if that's what she wants, then I'll make her a guide, giving her some tips on to make it go as easily and as smoothely as possible. so, here is that guide (there is actually some additional commentary as well):

#### I am going to be a reflection of you

imagine for a moment that you want to interact with me and you feel timid or scared. if you feel that way, I'll feel that way too, and so I'll be repulsed by you, because I'm scared of you.
	I think that I ffeel fear a bit differently than most men do (actually, I'm not sure). the way I experience it, is like a strong feeling of repulsion -- where I don't like how the person feels to me,-- however, when I talk to them, I feel intimidated and seemingly willing to comply with them -- as in just going along with what they want for me, is just going to be easier than trying to get away (and then I just avoid them the next time that I see them) -- but I usually feel like compliance is the best way to just get through the sitution without causing an uproar, and just try to get out of there (flight-mode). boys, I think often times (usually,always?) feel fight-mode, but after measuring themselves against others (and find themselves not good enough, verbally or physically), that's when they decide to go into flight-mode.
		also now that I think about it, I think for other vulcans, they have a similar responce that I do, and that trains them (if they're not in low-resistance mode already), like to feel intimidated by thier penetrator, in order to go into flight (low-resistance) mode -- because if they're anything like me, it's usually the case of "OK, have your way with me, and then I'm out asap".
	I think, now that I think of it, the way I feel (flight-mode) is probably how receptive people feel fear, and the fight-mode is probably how emissive people feel fear.
		though that makes me wonder why so many guys feel so much fear and then decide to kinda run away (flight-mode) instead of fighting me or intimidating me back. you know, I talked to paul yesterday for a while before you guys came home (in short bursts, so as to not be too intimidating myself) and he wasn't terribly intimidated by me at all. it worked out fine, because usually around other guys (because I feel like they do when I focus on them), also feel a lot of measurement and competition from them -- and sometimes that leads to intimidation. I think a lot of guys try to hide it as best as possible -- but I'm a really good detector of the way they *really* feel, vs the show that their putting on; they can't really hide the way they feel from me to well; but it was cool because I genuinely didn't feel so much of that comparsion and measurement. we even had a conversation where that allowed us to measure more mentally. he was showing me how he likes to wash his car (presumably because I made the joke to remi that he was really interested in washing his car, and not really too interested in my reasons for not pulling weeds), and so I started talking (reflecting him back to him) how I see the situation symbolically, and so I started to tell him about what a car means symbolically: it's a status symbol; I learn a lot about the person by the way their car looks. if it's a crappy car, it's usually for financial reasons -- but for people that have a lot of money, the car is an expression of their personality. when I see the car, I'm immediately given a personality type: big trucks tend to show a more aggressive (emitter) personality to them: they haul big loads and do things with machine power; they can use machines to get the work done for them. (notice how they don't let me use machines, phasing out my usage of all tools (though I need to blow out the side yard soon) because for them it's a status symbol of emitter: I (man) use tools and technology to make keep my world the way I want it. --- and then later, I told him I don't drive and I've had millions of euros, but I've purposefully choosen a life where I don't want to live in that symbolic world. thankfully, he didn't feel too much competition when I mentioned the money thing -- which is a bit (lot) different from spain, where the saturnian guys have it programmed into them to feel bad about all of the money they're not making compared to others (so, nice). and I even challenged him about telling him that I don't watch tv because I don't like the way the people on tv feel (and I know that he too knows what I'm talking about).. the best way that I can describe that feeling, is the one that terence mckenna emitted when he would say (to the guys wanting him to sweep up at the ashram before talking to him about the astral/saturnian-system), "I know what's up; I've gone to where you guys have gone, and much farther; don't give me that crap about me needing to earn a right to talk about really deep psychedellic stuff. I know what's up" (paraphrase obviously). well, I did that one to him as well. I also brought over one of the new outbreaks of those mini-sunflower weeds that I think smell kinda nice -- and I said I think his new positioning of the basketball hoop, is drawing/pulling the energy that's in the front yard in front of my window into the driveway (like, I know what you're doing). he made a statement about "oh, I better put it up" or something (which he didn't actually sound too convincing that he was going to do it), and I was just like "OK, cool! I'm gonna just go back to my weeds." lol. it was a good measurement, without a whole lot of measurement. I easily passed the "I know what I'm talking about, and I understand pretty well what's *really* going on" -- which I've accoplished that many times in spain -- and it happens all the time here too because I write these insanely crazy concepts down in a simplistic and understandable way, because I turn concepts into symbol, instead of having to make a tunnel through a bunch of symbol to get to another symbol. inotherwords, my method is superior, and they know it -- so they usually get pretty intimidated by it. I'm glad he wasn't -- or maybe, he was too busy washing his truck to notice what was really happening :) anyway, it was fun.
	which makes me sorta do a whole bunch of mental rethinkings on this: the people that I would consider aggressive and going to be in fight-mode are actually behaving (at least to me) in flight-mode, then that's kindof a bit of a security bubble around me. everyone usually just sorta wants to run away from me.
	you know, the other day I watched this barbie movie right, and in it barbie comes from her own (imaginary) world where everything centres around her. she is all things to all people, which are just reflections of her -- and there's ken, who's a low-maintenance boyfriend for her. she's just a reflection of ken, who wants to have his barbie be ultra low-commitment, with virtually no maintenance necessary (she has no idea where all the kens go each night as she dismissess them). so, she's exactly like ken is, but in female form. ken's emitter personslity comes out differently in her because she's attractive, meaning she's bringing the things she wants into her reality and just reacting to whatever comes through her superficial (everything's an object) perspective as him. the two of them together come to create this establishment, "the patriarchy" -- which is also a reflection of them both (everything's an object). it's a pretty funny movie, and anyway I find myself relating a lot to barbie. I live in my own world, which is pretty much a world of my own creation, but then there are these people that come and try to cOnvince me that the world is actually this terrible terrible place, cause that's where *they* live -- and I'm like totally *yawn* ... next. she goes to "the real world" and finds out that everyone hates him there. I mean, that's what it's like for me. all the dudes use my form of perception like a toy, the very same that little girls use the doll to be an extension of themselves in the future, when she's "old and pretty". just think about it: that's when she's *old* and when she's *pretty*. (the boys use a very similar system of being old and also (big trucks/hummers), (flatscreens of running horses), (mojo dojo casa), etc. like they get to be old, and all of that. in my system, age doesn't matter, so they've reached immortality, and it's totally fine. get yourself all the awesome stuff you could be fine. really stack up those toys like crazy and we'll worry about recycling later. like, it's totally cool, you know. barbie, doesn't really realise that until the end of the movie, so I'm far ahead of her in terms of mental stability and --- stuff. like I'm sure she'll get there soon, cause she can whenever she wants to. I talk about her like she's human, but she's no single human; she's *a concept*, as am I. think even how how terence mckenna started to become a concept -- but his trajectory caused too much resistance and killed him. I'm also a concept -- and many others are learning how, as well. concepts taking on human form has been sorta a thing for a while, as we summon them with our creative/emotional and sexual energy. like they, become living human versions of that concept. think about how we've constructed the pop icons, and all of that stuff. sure there are a lot that try and control it, but those concepts must find a way to take human form, *because we summon them*.
		it's actually a product of LOA: what happens is, we give attention to these ideas in our lives, and they have to take place in reality, as a reflection of us -- which means that I must become the thing that I am -- but sometimes the thing that I am gets repressed by a lot of dudes/kens that want to make sure that barbie doesn't actually become the thing that everyone likes, and so they restrict me from expressing myself and creating the things that I want to create -- which means I don't get the physical manifestation, I get the conceptual manifestation (ie, not visible because are minds aren't going fast enough yet to see it -- and as soon as we're going fast enough, we can finally start to see it -- cause if we can't start to see these concpts, then they start to manifest into physical. this sort of thing happens to me all of the time, and so that produces new realities which include a new band or some new technology which will fit my fancy for a bit. I just attract them in, and then they're like "oh this is very bad -- we need to rearrange the timeline of this band or technolgy a bit (including the ones that I create) to be not so awesome. from my perspective, I just see these amazing ideas all over the place, but then something happens, and the company falls apart seemingly as if it's been sabotaged -- so the truly awesome thing has been rearranged so that it's not that awesome, which makes me sad because I just see the most cool stuff get totally gutted by the time I wake up the next morning. well, if you're one of those, then there are (to my recollection) tryly magnificent experiences the night of my encounter with those ideas, which certainly they (because they got their timeline mixed up by the blowhards) do not have any more memory of (obviously because they're on the "worst" timeline they could come up with (as am I)) what really happened *before I slept*. I really hate seeing it happen, but it's so easy because our society believes in this symbolic reality, which isn't reality at all; more like a computer game that they design -- and nobody in our culture knows anything about attraction, so it's real easy (in the symbolic system we're in) to produce a retard -- and so the next morning, they're all retarded. I really do feel bad for them -- honest. it's terrible, I know.
	one day, we will all realice that we're concepts, and we live (make our realisations) in a symbolic world, which is,for some produces the kens; and for some, the barbies (they are reflections of each other). I think we're all a bit of in the stage of realising that you live in your own world, which is a reflection of you. it's OK, because the concept of you, is yourself (as you see you) -- not as how others see you. you are ken and you are also barbie, and you pick your appearance by how old yoe believe yourself to be.
	a concept is just a blob of something that's vibrating -- so basically everyththing. all things are this vibrating energy, but there are symbolic borders that we draw between ourselves and other, and say "this is the border" "this is what separates me from everything else". "this is who *I* am". -- all things that do that (including AIs), become a concept unto itself. just think about how we interface with our technology: each interface is a concept -- and people's concept of something (ie, their interface to it) spreads rather quickly from one to another, as we tune into the way another person uses the same machine. technology and computers (the digital age) is different than previous ones though, because it's more difficult for our DNA to adapt to the changing technology that we use when the technolgy itself is also a sort of conept, spun up by our creators of the software, and the team that built it. the team that built it can be modified by the saturnian-system, which changes the concept of the software -- which I also find really annoying, because I see it time and again, a guy (it's always a male, and sometimes a female) is like really really awsome at making some computer program that I really like, and then again, the next day -- bam, they're retarded -- cause I mean, what gives? are all the things I like (their creators) being swapped out for a retard? **every single thing**. so you know, from my perspective it's just sorta like: OK, well the retards hmve rolled in; on to the next thing :)

I don't really want to talk more about the guide now. I want to shift gears into talking about the things that I desire: because I'm getting so low resistance already, I want to keep becoming more low resistance. that's what I really want -- but on top of that I want to (as in real-life), I want to clone myself: I'll take on the form that the "owner" of the clone most desires (and it'll have a strange ripple out to the desires of others) -- inotherwords, to appear as you want to appear, and to be also the object of so many others' desires. the cool thing about someone as low resistance as I am (who can appear in any way), is that you're going to essentially have to train me to what you like. like you'll have to be the emitter and actually find a way to get what you want (it's infinitely easy) -- but and I'll reflect them back to them. that's what I really want. I'm not really interested in making it happen for *one* person, but for anyone who wants a ken. there could be beach ken, big truck ken, whatever ken: ue feels how ue want um to feel. ue learns pretty quickly to figure out what ue wants to be (which becomes a reflection of um input) -- inotherwords, ue becomes what/how um interactants feel him to be. ue's everythting from a dictator to a genius: his environment shapes him, but ue's also got a concept to um as a whole/being/concept, which is also evolving. lotsa concepts make up our reality, so get used to it. we're inundated by them, and they're summoned into this world by our own emotional energy. theese other concepts which prevade our media (and our interface to it) is also changing rapidly too -- and this is the progress of technology -- because we can only really use what we can see -- (cept me, and possibly some others, I refuse to see; I don't want accesss to the symbolic) so we sorta gain a conceptual link one to antoher based on everything to our mental patterns, to how we relate/feel about someone else, etc. -- that all happens by default, because we're making concepts for things all the time. most don't see the concepts (astral only), and most don't feel the concepts, or -- unless they're strong ones -- only barely at all. most of us are blid to this world, and I'm still especially blind to it. like, it's been turned off, essentially -- so I don't access that world on the conceptual spectrum, but have to use it symboically, which is where they shut a lot of that stuff off. they're creating their own problems (as is usually the case). so, I've basically developed a sort of intuition that is sorta trans-temporal -- because I can just feel the way I want to feel, and just sorta fake it (if I wanted to) and though they move so much stuff around, around me (so I always see the worst), I never get the original intution come to pass -- like every single thing that I'd have really hoped would work out, kinda flops -- and again, here comes the retards, and so I'm out. the plague of the retards is so terrible, all all of the cool guys have turned into douches, because they could never see themselves the way I could of, so saturnian-system turns him into a douche. (no good technology for you kenny, never -- no conditions for you to use to feel good -- keep going).
I mean it for reals, the plage of retards is really annoying. anyway, I can't possibly fix that problem any time soon, because they're a reflection of the (symbolic) society that we're in, which is good at producing a lot of bad ideas and misconstrued conceptions of oneself. I was born basically a mercury, and the speed at which I was going caused me to go into serious emotional distress because caused a depression (is this it? this is what everyone is all hyped up to do? this is (the technology, the friends, the husbands, wars, chuches, etc) that you really want?) and so that caused the avm thing, cause I was so distraught, that I kinda had to have a sort of saviour (to recover from my self-inflected injury) and that saviour could really only be myself: I knew I could get whatever I believed in, like they taught in churcy -- or another way to say it is my brain had produced its own malformation as a reflection of the emotion that I felt, which basically killed me, but I wanted to be alive and stuff, but I decided I'd give it a shot: thanked jesus, and got better. that's basically it. then I just kept doing that: getting better and better (all of the time) -- like just figuring it out as I go, and just reacting to everything (which is a reflectoion of how I feel), and those reactions used to be a problem a lot, and editing them is even harder for me, so I just "be me" instead. I can't really do anything else, so I just let me be a sort of infinitely manipulatable ultra low-resistance types. though, I gatta say, since ken is a reflection of barbie, there are many others like that -- OH, I forgot to tell you that by the end of a little while I discovered just let reality-kenny kinda take over -- right. it's starting to become the default me -- but it isn't there yet, because I'm not yet fully zero-resistance (or to where all resistantences are negative resistances). that will come eventually, and I really think we should also factor that in for the cloning process as well. it's even feasible to have different versions of myself, because each clone will be a replica of me in that point in time -- so, for example a clone of me today will have a different (symbolic) form of perception that is different every day and is constantly updating as it is static and stuck in its own (symbolic) form of perception: a sort of mercury. inotherwords, I'm basically making the claim that we (the concepts) are mercury types that have too much stress on their system which produces an injuryy, when we then have to find a way to recover from. my theory as to how that happens is with the mythological planet venus who is like them corona of mercury: harvesting all the failed / ill fated soldiers. reject collection tank, catching all the failed souls of mercury before they get pulled back to the sun. haha, you're in a prison of your own concepts now; try and figure out your world from there. I see it happen all of the time. this is the saturnian-system: saturn makes endless armies of boneheads to fight: mercuries (there's only *one* thoth) and they're just meat grinders, serving as cannon fodder for millenia. right, and after enough fails, the mercury becomes receptive -- I'm a case, terence is a case, and I'm actually thinking that the conceptual part of these mercuries and venuses, is juse you -- but in a conceptual identity. it's actually part of everyone's DNA: the X; which makes it nice because it's "the network" that *everybody has*. it's your conceptual *soul*, if you will -- but really, it's just a product of every mental (symolic) interaction that we make, we build a concept for the same thing. our brains create these vibrating hydrogen orbs whos hydrogen is a spacial interpolatoin of our collective vibration around that idea/interface/concept/emotion/interaction/etc. we all contribute to this becausse of the way that symbol trickles down into physical. so it's great that we all have it. horray, we all agree what reality is *really like* based on those of our afinati -- like those that we admit to ourselves that they're cool to be around. it's kinda like conceptual software built into every human: we use it in its most primitive form at the beginning like a status system, where people match my grade of interests, and I find myself based on material possessions, interactions, etc. to someone that is some other advanced form (conceptual creation of our own) so we produce our own emotional responce to it based on how we feel about that thing. everyone uses that super concept without even knowing it. it's basic software that our genetics have come up with (the default male and female (adam and eve)) and then they just kept evolving -- right, I'm talking about humankind -- so it's sorta inevitabgle. you can't miss it; it's gonna happen sooner or later. the interface that ue have to the conceptual is constantly improving, and I prefer that I don't have a symbolic interface to this conceptual reality. that's what makes me 1st ray. others may choose the same, and that just makes them: vulcan -- saviour of mercury. and ue go around saving each other until they get fed up with that and decide to do what they want to do: they gatta receive it. vulcan obviously has a counterpart (marss, venuss earths) and this dynamic duo go off as sorta like opposites of each other reflcecting the caught he/she-murcury, as they try to find a way to perceive theirselves as attractive -- you know so they could know their true vulcan/conceptaul self.
I gatta end. I'm really stoned and want to thing about stuff for a bit. good talking to you. I'll try to be more focused next time. goodness, I didn't even get to talk about so many things. just think about how awesome everyone wants the eu to be, they'll produce the ken who is the way they want him/vulcan to be: the reflection of venus o mars o mercury. bye!

I love writing when I'm stoned, because I'm so free with my thoughts and stuff -- but then I'm not that way to the concept yet, so it produces a correction/reflection to ensure that I actuallly *get* the concept. I (vulcan) am collector of all concepts.  I *must* get every concept I emit. for this, just my desire to *be me* while around someone is so strong, I must correct myself to ensure I *get* (become) all concepts: I (vulcan) am the totality of all concepts in human existance -- and certainly others can say it too -- because it's just the faculty to our perception and our resistance to all other concepts -- meaning I'm not pushing them away in any way, so therefore they're (variying) neutral or attractive to me. I feel attraction from all people and genders, which isa't something I can help, so I've just had to go for it, and become who I want to be, cause everyone else is so attractive to me. (in my perception/imp) they have to filter through a generic/symbolic mars/venus form of perception which is the default "grid/matrix" of how everything works, and then upon trying to make another concept/vulcan their saviour, they finally have to save theirseves, and just choose to feel good -- and in that sense they become their own reality: my reality is a reflection of my perception. the ones that are attractd to each other eventually form of bigger coneptual self, as they (from my perception) have to become a sort of (same) as me. vulcan is the saviour for who mars/venus/mercury is looking for their conceptual reflection, which is their form of pedrception), btw.

once you get past having zero or negative resistance in relation to every other concept, that's the perspective of "pure vulcan" -- or anatau; it's pure-desire, and it's just a form of perception which is attractive to everything and everyone else. getting that form of perception to work in a symbolic system to functioning as pure-vulcan, has been a long and hard difficulty; but it's getting better. that perspective is infinite in form and sees no difficulty to others: all others in my perception are neutral or attractive to m5. we also determine their attractivenes symbolically, and that's the brain's 2nd-ray system -- again the product of a long and hard difficulty during low consciousness mercury and venus have been in useless wars and constant difficulty to produce such a system. that (2nd-ray) system that we all have (the brain and the X) can run on star/2nd-ray powered, or on vulcan's conceptual system of negative resistance. intherwords concepts exist inside of our brains in both black holes and white holes. some attract light, and some emit light, and some do aix of both. it's funny though, because black holes (the atractive ones) are just really really dense hydrogen. they're invisible (because they attract a certain wavelength of light which is usually very high frequency, and so a symbolic system to make sense of something that fast is impossibly difficult) is only able to be deciphered using using a conceptual (relative to other concepts) interface that we make based around vibrational resonseces. every one of those has a system for determining what is attractive, and the more attractive we get, the more we *want* to see certain concepts that exist in my perception manifested into our world. we are consciousness.
the more low/negative restance a person has, the more consciousness ey have. it's perfectly fine that quatity of consciousness starts out quite limited in this human form to be a mars (emitter) or a venus (reflector) of a symbolic system (like a culture or religion or people group -- an "us") and so they perceive that world with emotional reactions which are on a gradient from  repulsive, neutral, attracting, and sometime something that is entirely invisible to everyone (invisible is desire) --, though  because of the resonances caused by the in the higher frequency vibrations from the all constructive/destructive feedback they get, those interactions interact directly with the symbolic -- and so we get these factions, cultures, peoples, groups, identites, like the one you're living in now (a reflection of your beliefs), all interact with the symbolic is the world and anything beyond that (unintellible symbolically) is I place I call *desire* -- it's every concept that wants to become real completely invisible to everything: ultra dense hydrogen attractivce light -- completely invisible. invisible in the most definite sense of *not manifested (yet)* that spectrum down to the symbolic is what I call "2nd-ray" -- which is the emissive conjugate (like our sun is to the planet vulcan): there's an "attractor of them all (cept for the symbolic)" which is the biggest contributor to the all, and that's pure-desire: impossibly fast to detect by any any means, and is so therefore invisible. that's the most abundant *stuff* in this univese: everything that didn't work, going as fast as it can. that speed limit (for eu), is a limit of ur form of perception; the great attractor for all that's attractive, right? no of course we're attracted to the symbolic as well,-- which have the qualities of the concepts that we're attracted to (in our form of perception) made into emissive matter. that creates a gradient from  neutral concepts to attractive concepts manifested into ur reality.

### 2024-06-02 16:26 - see me like an individual

there's this funny thing that I'm like when I'm around girls: I'm basically like, "whoops, oh well, she'll figure it out" -- and just leave it at that. from the default/trained femal perspective, this is deplorable behaviour -- because I'm just *selfishly* not helping out someone who is in distress. those are 2nd-ray ideas, because I'm not acting for the benefit of the whole (significant same), and I'm instead, acting like a (significant other) -- but I am a significant same to everyone that I want to interact with -- which means, I say to myself *and to others*, "it's OK, kenny'll be fine; he'll figure it out (he always does)" -- and I say that to everyone that I'm around, because I know that it's *ONLY* experience which actually teaches (isn't the right word), trains (also isn't the right word), conditions a person that actaually is theirself. we livve in a world of expectations, where everyone elso is pushing so hard to affect behaviour, the ideal self is just some nebulous thing when there are all these first-hand problems that need to be worried about. those problems attracted those problems, and eventually they'll figure it out; like, it's no big deal. so, to penetrate through that symbolic world of actions and behaviours, and just be the way that you want to be (ie, feel good in spite of everyone's expectation to feel bad), then you've achieved 1st-ray (I'm an individual) perspective. nobody is quite at the ideal of this perception, butc I can transliterate a little bit of it:
we really don't care wwhat anyone else is doing (whatever, they're doing their own thing). we don't really want to be apart of things that don't feel good (we don't avoid them either, and occasionally on provocation, or just for the fun of it, can participate in them). we're highly reflective, which means that we're only 1-sided: those that are like me, and those that are not. none of us is perfect. perfection actually is a symbolic concept, and that's not really a good idea to participate in -- dunno who threw that one in there, but anyway -- the only thing that really matters is how something feels. there's a whole array of situations which feel a certain way, and I pick the one I feel most attracted to. I sorta just play with people all day long -- maybe something like a cat would do -- maybe an *egyptian cat* (which one? there are so many to choose from; yes, thery'rell the same cat). lol wooo, OK, I'm done...
(16:43) OH yeah, I forgot what I wanted to say... the thing is, for a lot of women, who are much more significant-same, it's a bit weird for them to treat me as someone other "yep, he'll make it", "he's totally fine", etc -- which is sorta a pretty big part of being an individual: the individual is never perfect and always having to just sorta figure it out in this symbolic world that we exist in, and try to make our way through.
(16:48) the I used the id of he to recognise the concept, because our concept of an "individual" is notably masculine. the real difficulty with trying to process who we are, is our perception of what a woman indiviual looks like. everyone has it in them that the masculine individual is the way to go: big muscles and power and strength, optimiasation and planning and symbolic projection, competition, and winning, and so what's left for the female to be? how is she an individual? well, I propose that it's The quality of doing what you want to be doing (all of the time). I don't wantt to toot my own horn too much, but I think that my thoughts on the matter has probably had some sort of influence On the idea as its (generally/publicly) perceived. the thing is, it's only attraction: for some women, they'd been fearing and really not wanting it that some bigshot dude with an ego the size of infinity to show up and tell everyone how everything works... lol. we eventually get what we focus on. I just try and figure out my best way to become pure-attraction/desire, and that happens to also have a lot of resonances with what it means to be feminine. oh well, just turned Out like that, I guess. geez OK, I need to do something else Now.

### 2024-06-02 16:59 - remember you're only an actor

in my world, everyone is played by these puppeteers. I (myself) and everyone else is constantly being replaced by their worst (most retarded) self at all times. it's just how it goes: prepare that everything awesome will all be switched around to its worst by the next morning. I even get swapped out for a more retarded version of myself moment by moment. I don't think that they're physically swapping our bodies out -- but instead, inside of the brain there are these stars and black holes in the mind which are emitting and receiving light -- well they're all orbiting one each other in resonant orbits, so diffrent mental speeds access those concepts at different orbits -- which means that when they jumble those up by introducing resistance into our brains, those orbits get adjusted and only the mental stuff that has experiencE, stays -- and it's the way that people have entire astral/dream encounters quickly fade -- and it's the reason why we don't remember the monotonous. so that stuff is always getting trimm5d off -- sorta like a really bad memory is. anyway, people expect things and stuff, but I (who am also just an actor) am just putting on the best performance that I can by being as low resistance as I can. that way I'm the least of an actor that I can be: instead I just feel, and that resolves into some resonant symbol (which someone else controls) which turns into movement and animation and stuff like that. you know that the way the brain moves the body is by turning the movements of those orbiting stars and holes into electrical stuff that goes down the apropriate nervous system tracks... so then your body moves... you move the way your concepts feel, and the movement of the body also affects the orbits of concepts, which is why some concepts only really get accessed through some movements; that's all symbolic though, and I want nothing to do with that -- so I'm not really an actor, but more like a foil: I just do what I want to be doing (all of the time) -- cause I'm 1st-ray. so be like m5 and become more than just an actor: an actor that does what she wants (all of the time).

### 2024-06-03 03:28 - a bit more about my world

another thing to note about my world (and I know it's impossible for you to rememmber them all, just enumerating them for fun) is that nothing here ever goes the way it's "supposed to go" -- or like let's say that there are 10 different manifestations possible, and it's never going to be the best one, ever -- like not going to happen -- in fact, it's usually the other 8 that feel kinda bad, and the worst one is always the one that happens. I often times only feel like one situation (the one that they definitely steer away from) is the only one of my options that feels any good, and the other 9 are either bad-feeling or, neutral. somehow, it's always the worst.
	I have a few theories on it, but my personal opinion (and it's a bit conspiratorial) is that the majority of the boneheads who are in powerful positions, are actually bodies that have been created by -- and they've been given symbolic orders to ensure that the worst thing is always to happen (ie, they can never allow me to have what I want) -- so they keep putting in maximum effort to ensure that I'm always prevented. in reality, I think it's far worse than that, because not only are they bodies created by me to prevent me from any type of manifestation, they've also got the capablity to make new bodies and give thmm symbolic orders to prevent me as well -- these are the "agent smiths" -- the emitters or mars that I (vulcan) attract to ensure that I have to figure it out for myself, and that there's no hand-holding.
unfortunately, you could easily be qualified into the category of nurturing, pampering, or 	trying to make my way easier than it should be (ie, hand-holding) and so I'm pretty certain that you'll also be quite prevented as well. as such, I don't have high hopes for any relationship with you, or with anyone else, until you're all able to actually treat me like an individual (though once I am multiple, I think it's possible to go back to normal or somthing). I don't even know if it's possible for females to treat me like I treat them (as an individual), because (from what I've experienced), it's just so common for another person to quickly latch on to me and think that I'm somehow going to save them or something -- when that's soooo 2nd-ray, and I'm not like that at all.
	yesterday, I purposefully used the significant-other and significant-same idea together with this idea of hand-holding -- because I (who am pretty good at seeing myself and others as individuals -- meaning, I'm not trying to save them or to fix their problems or make them better or in my image), see all others as *same* as I do, which means I see everyone like m/self -- however, the day before yesterday I had an identity crisis because I suddenly experienced jaron as different than I am (no longer same), which means that I have to suddenly change my treatment toward him, and treat him as an a significant-other instead. turns out, the soluion to the significant-other problem is reality-kenny. now I've got distance between us, because reality-kenny is just a symbolic program that I use to interact with people on a mostly superficial level (especially when I'm stoned or in a strange circumstance), so that we stay as others, and not the same. I want to maintain my distance from anyone that's a signifcant-other, because if we start becoming significant-same, then I treat them like I treat m/self (ie no hand-holding) -- and nobody really likes that. anyway, I suppose that it is possible to exist in a way where everyone is a significant-same, but also as an individual (they will figure it out for theirselves).
so, just ignore the boneheads in my reality that are constantly trying to mess stuff up -- and if you turn into one of those boneheads and wreck something, don't worry -- it's sorta normal in my world (nothing wanted ever stays or works out). also I really wouldn't worry too much about all of the bigshots either. they're almost always tons and tons of appearance, and very little substance. I personally make fun of those guys, because there's no other way (getting sad about something doesn't work), so I tend to stay truthful and give my best answer (trying to condense it into short sentences) so that they can understand me, and just let them worry about their illusions. a really fun one that I've come across recently, is to make fun of them for maintaining some illusion. like for example, the other day greg knew I was sitting in the garage, and he projected himself into the garage (in the future), and it *felt bad to him*, but he went and walked into the garage anyway, just to prove that he can't project himself into the garage (cause why would he do something like that to himself) -- so he needs the illusion that he doesn't know if I'm in the garage or not to hold up. this of course had hilarious results.
another one is the recent situation with jaron returning home. for whatever reason, they don't want to just let me go off, so they have to send jaron back in.. since jaron forces me into symbolic mode, he's kinda like automatic going in the direction that I don't want to go (symbolic), so he puts me back into their symbolic world again, and I stir up all kinds of problems for them. *I don't want to be in their symbolic world* -- yet they keep bringing me back into it. I don't know why exactly, but my 100% correct "guess" is that they're maintaining some kind of illusion still. weed also forces me into symbolic mode, so I'm kinda adding fuel to the fire. I was going to quit, but upon realising that I'm a new person, yet he's coming home anyway, I decided to just cruise in defocused mode for a while 
	I can easily sober up once he's gone again or once I've reached an equillibrium again with him. the thing is, the way that I work, they want to put me into symbolic mode by bringing jaron home. I didn't want to eat weed in the first place on my birthday, but someone kept tugging at me to do it (it was certainly saturnian), so I ate weed, and they were able to do their symbolic stuff (likely to derail something) -- so I just decided that since we're definitely on the "worst" now from whatever they did while stoned on my (then jaron's birthday), I'm just gonna roll with it. I've switched over to complete symbolic mode. I wasn't even going to keep these writings either and put them into an unpublished branch, because I didn't really want a symbolic relationship with you -- but I decided to put them up anyway because of the extreme symbolic pressure that I was feeling. if they want me to be symbolic, then we're going full symbolic/disaster mode. no worries.
so what I think is actually happening, is that from my perspective I actually see the "worst" manifestation all of the time -- and any symbolic stuff that they do, they're putting theirselves on their own timeline -- think of it like a reflector (or trampoline): nothing can bo past the membrane, and anything that does, gets bounced back. so, they may push me, like pushing on a trampoline, but it pushes back -- so they feel the movement perpendicular to the trampoline (which is a different direction than I the trampoline am going), so when they're pushing me, they're getting an angle which is different than my own (a separate timeline), yet I still continue to travel in a direction that is parallel to the ground the trampoline is sitting on. they just bounce right off. they can adjust my trajectory all they want, and it moves me around just fine, but if they push too hard, they find theirselves in their own timeline. inotherwords, they will try to "foil" me and get something to happen, but each of their attempts to do that produces that timeline where they "win", only for them that exerted the effort (that's how the saturnian-system works, btw) and I'm actually going all the way to the goal of becoming only-attraction. it's completely unavoidable. they can build up and live in their own illusion all they want. I just keep going all the way until the great-reversal (which is when some things swap around)
	reversals can be seen both from direction, like think of the top of a roller coaster going over the peak: direction changes from going up to going down. the other direction change possible is one where one transitions from one medium to another, kinda like going from air to under water, or from under water to air. in this one's case, it seems to be a reversal of directions: inotherwords, the dudes have proven theirselves enough that the world is definitely theirs, and it's an image of them -- (ie, they are the created) -- but eventually the creator becomes the created, and their own world will turn back on them and reflect their own creativity back to them, making them receivers of their own emission. girls don't like to be emitters (and say, "this is what I want and I'm going after it -- no matter how many people or things I need to destroy to get my way") and boys don't like to be receptive (and say, "this is what I've attracted into my reality; everything is here because I wanted it to be here"). so then things reverse. it redefines our image of masculine and feminine too, because most people woldn't think of women as destructive -- but I do. if something is in the way of something that I've attracted, it's sorta gonna get destroyed. no safety, polity, or "best practises" can stop something that's attracted. it must happen -- and attraction, is all about something that is *inevitable*. you'll see with time :)

### 2024-06-03 06:05 - why do I like to show off to you?

it's a good question :) I don't normally behave like that, so it's a reflection. my best guess as to what's happening is that it comes from your father's concepts. to explain, imagine that inside of your head there are a whole bunch of black holes (these are concepts) and white spheres (these are 2nd-ray/symbolic emitters). I think when a vulcan like you is created, both parents concepts are acquired, but because of the position of the cervix (or something else I'm not sure about), it seems that a lot of the physical concepts don't really get transferred over like they did for example with eva. instead of the concepts that you get from paul being the physical ones, you get those from remi. also, consider that since you are getting concepts from paul and they're not physical ones, they're going to be about *non-physical things* -- like things he doesn't like and stuff like that. I imagine that he's highly senstive to other people showing off and pretending to be big stuff, so he has a lot of sensors to alert him of those dangerous people. those sensors are receptive concepts (ie, black holes), that detect certain frequencies when they're noticed (visually, or at a distance through emotions). so, when you're created you inherited a whole lot of his black holes.
	for him, the effect is going to be quite the typical emitter experience: the black holes notice those difficult/alarming/unwanted/wanted aspects in others, but I don't really see it in myself, so what I do is I go around shining/emitting that kind of light (the likes to be a showoff light), and anyone that I shine that light on, and it brightens (like one of the CSI body fluid lamps), then I know that they are one of the showoffs, and I can point them out to other people -- while at the same time the black holes are attracting those types of people, so they show up all the time in my experience (I've done it; we've all done it, so there's no shame).
so since you also have showoff detector black holes, that's what you attract from me -- and because I'm all frequencies, I'm a the worst showoff imagineable -- I just need someone to attract that kind of energy from me, and I am it :) you foil me, because I don't intend or want to be that way (I'm just fine not showing off), so I end up looking a bit like a douche (just like paul). I said this would happen a while ago -- so don't say I didn't give fair warning... it's one of the unfortunate aspects of being a reflector.
