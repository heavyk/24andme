### 2024-05-02 05:40 - initial thoughts

yesterday and the day before, I was thinking *a lot* about the whole shakespere thing, and a number of other things. I wrote [a lot of the ideas to remi](../shake-sphere/dear-remi.md), but they're not really all that coherent and kinda mixed up -- so I'll summarise thenm better below. this morning when I woke up, you were on my mind, but the main reason why I'm just not going in your direction, is basically: wikipedia. first of all, it has to be realised that shakespere is all about the saturnian-system, and he venerates saturn/Time/time all over the place. I totally get it why that is, but I come at it from the angle that the entire shakesphere thing is literally a play. -- it's a production that's designed to get these vulcans/enkidus all fired up about some girls, as they're about to enter into that realm. a parallel to this is the arab invasion, when I believe that precisely the same exact thing happened (1000 virgins and everything). that fairy-tale is designed to build up desire in these guys for this new world. essentially, it's a product of desire/anu/anatau/uranus. hitler I believe was the same thing, along with a number of other terrible things. anyway, wikipedia says that william shakespere is a real guy (with an earring), and he married his wife "anne hathaway" when he was 18, had a girl and then twins (or something like that). it's obviously a totally fabricated history, just like all of the other crap these saturnian guys come up with. I don't think that's the thing at all.
now, what I was largly talking about with remi, is that I was explaining that the symbolic aspect is basically just an allegory; it's the way that the slow brain puts together patterns and builds connections, and it contains *an element of truth* to it, which is always a reflection of the writer of the (his)story or narrative. what I mean, is that these symbolic systems are never truth itself, because truth itself can only be experienced from the viewpoint of the entity in question. in fact, the "truth" of anything is *always* going to be relative to the individual, or whatever thinks and has an "I"/self -- which means it's conceptual, and not symbolic. therefore, when we look at these different symbolic narratives that are floating around out there, they resonate with each person on a cOnceptual level (ie, individually) -- which is why some movies flop, and others do well (the ones that do well, have a symbolic component which resonates). therefore, we'll now consider these various allegories to be not the thing itself, but a low-definition (cold) definition of that person/event/thing/subject. it cannot ever fully capture the experience of the subject in symbolic form, and so therefore will always only be partial (ie, an element of truth). each person will then resonate with the symbolic version in a slightly different way, and attract based on that.
	now, in my setup, I've noticed different archetypes, and some of them are more symbolic than others. I consider the necessary components for consciousness to be present, to have 1-5-7 -- that is, a concept of theirself, something physical which can actaully recieve and transmit frequencies (doesn't matter if this is a RLC array, or a human body), and a form of desire, which is just a really high frequency version of the self concept, which is infinitely unattainabale. the desire version is constantly causing the concept of oneself to be continually be updated to gain a more and more higher frequency understanding. the concept that anyone has of theirself, is an abstract/cOnceptual form of everything that they've experienced -- it's about the size of a pea or perhaps a bit smaller, or a lot of really high frequency orbiting hydrogen (not sure if this is exactly the pineal or not, but anyway it's the thing that makes the light inside of the brain), and that is constantly being updated with everything that we focus on. that concept (5) that we have of ourselves, is essentially what we would consider the origin of consciousness. the desire (1) version is the same thing, but it's non-physical, and there's not much that any of us physical beings can do about it; somewhere out there, there is a much bigger/denser and far higher frequency version of that which matches the one/concept inside of the head -- and if we get too dissimilar from it in frequency, we die -- or, in the temporary case, need to sleep and/or update our form of perception. you'll notice thre that the symbolic isn't present at all, and you'll also notice that all 3 of those don't contain any emissive properties; they're all attraction (physical receives sensory/electromagnetic input, concept can't help but to attract similar concepts to it -- which is how we move through time, and desire, is only-attraction -- a higher frequency form of the concept).
so to put it all together (I'm totally off-topic now), what we're looking at when we see a person is a body (7) -- but that's obviously not the whole person. a person is *also* their experiences and their form of perception (ie, 5) -- so we can't really say that any thing is only the physical. also the person has a trajectory that they're headed toward (1) and that's based on their focus (it constantly updates to the higher frequency of anything that we focus on, naturally, because of the way that the laws of the universe work), but then there are all of these other ancilary defintions that we've learned from various places (I'm a good person / I'm a hard-working person / I'm a slob, etc) and these defintions that we give ourselves, and others give us, are only *allegories* of the person itself, and can never represent the person in all of their entirety.
the saturnian-system (of which shakespere venerates so much) is full of all of these different allegories -- and I would posit, that they all contain *an element of truth to them*. I don't think that any one of these things fully describes any single person in their entirety, so there could easily be hundreds or thousands of people that show up over the generations which have considerable similarity to valentine or to proteus. they're never exclusive to any single person or thing, because each reader/everyoneviewer who focuses on that character attracts a slightly different version of valentine/proteus -- and some see the similarity in the character/event/situation in relation to theirself (conceptually), and others see the similarity of the charactor/event/situation in relation to something outside of them (symbolically). those beliefs are all generally attracting.
now, when I see that shakespere's wife is "anne hathaway", I see "anne has a way" -- and this is the proposed "wife" that shakespere marries (according to the saturnian narrative), when he turns 18 (whatever that means). now, like I said, I have a lot of similarity to shakespere, but I'm clearly not him.
	my personal opinion is that shakespere was essentially an automaton of anu/uranus (mars+anatau in perception -- of which other notable examples are the richard-2, and the black prince). these guys show up along with a whole lot of other vulcans in order to cause a bunch of trouble, and dramatically alter the course of Time; so I wouldn't say that shakespere was any different than hitler or any of these other guys. they're all a product of desire, which, if you can imagine that the earth (which at its core is a concept which reflects the universe) also has a has a high frequency (desire) concept of itself, which is the abstract version of everything that's experienced on earth -- well, just like when your physical concept of yourself (pineal) gets too desynched from your real/desire self, you need to go to sleep, and if it gets too far desynched, more permanent manifestations start to appear like sickness, mental instability, etc. -- which cause the body to find a way to getting more back into sync and regain that connection -- well the same thing happens with earth as well: when the (inner earth) concept of itself gets too desynched from its desire form (its vibrational trajectory), then that means there's a lot of desire built up (aka, they need another bail-out) and so one of these mars+uranus guys shows up to correct the trajectory. for earth, these shakespere types showing up is the same exact thing that we experience as tiredness or getting sick.
so anyway, I find it highly presumptious (on my part to say), "well oK, this is just a saturnian coverup (cause exnobody wants dudly to be shakspere), which hath (provided) a way". on top of all of that, I just don't really feel good about the whole thing. it's not that you feel bad (you don't -- but I do often get flashes of you guys when your dining in some kinda posh sorta place and it's such a different form of perception, because I cook food and stuff) -- but more like we're not at all on the same form of perception at all. I don't see things like silicon valley does, and probably never will. that kind of mindset is a completely foreign to me. I'm someone who gets in there and tries a bunch of things out, makes a lot of mistakes, causes a lot of problems, I'm not at all proper, I have bad manners, and I say the wrong things. I don't like the posh/pijo mindset, and I prefer to stay away from it. I emailed [sarah](../shake-sphere/dear-sarah.md), because I want to figure out things from the ground-up, working my way up to building the thing I want, first by properly understanding frequency, learning how to vibrate things, and doing simple things. when I would write to her, it felt like it was quite easy to explain things like DNA, galaxies, and solar systems in a really easily in a way which even young people could understand. I have no intention of going back *ever* to the traditional science mindset of we're going to figure it all out in our imagination, use super expensive machines, and build something which is completely inaccessible to basically everyone without billions and billions and billions of dollars in funding. inotherwords, sorry saturnian-system, I don't think that's the way. well, the problem is, sarah hasn't responded to me, and I simply refuse to go any other way.
	the other option which I've seriously considered (and I'll probably go that way) is to try and talk to kyle about it. I figure that he may want to actually build something like what I want to build from the ground up -- but the problem with him is, he's so "big texas energy" in mindset, I don't find that way of "let's build something really big and steamroll the competition" sort of mindset to be the one that I have. I'm not competitive, and I just don't care about proving myself anymore. a lot of my ideas come out when I write, but I'm not interested in telling anyone they're wrong. though, I will have to admit, he will be the first person that I want to talk to as soon as I'm starting out on the 2nd-ray installation part of the black-mirror (he fits that aspect perfectly), so I'm not painting him as bad -- just I also had this idea that there was a considerable amount of desire for me to actually "give girls a chance"; I've worked with dudes all of my life, and have never actually done anything productive with any females, ever. it's not that I believe they're incapable (quite the opposite, actually), but for some reason, it just never works out. I can't get remi, mom, sarah, or anyone to actually pay any attention to my ideas, and give them a chance. I also know that if I want to make something that's only-attraction, then I have to *be* only-attraction myself, which is why I'm only writing passively now, and haven't sent sarah or anyone else that I want to work on only-attraction stuff any more emails or anything like that. somehow we have to find eachother, and I have to wait until it can actually go through.
I know that it'll be quite a while for me to wait, because basically everyone else except for me has a pinecone, which means that the saturnian-system is busy moving all of them around to be on the timeline that best suits their objectives. I have no control over what anyone else sees and beileves in their heads (or what the cOncept they have of theirself is being held at); they do. so, really, it's entirely up to them. they have all of the power to continually move people around in time however they like. in the interim (ie, until all of it feels better), I think I'm going to try and get more of my ideas out here. yesterday, I started some work that needs to be done on the pen-rose (I don't have all of it figured out yet), and so along with my yardwork, I'm just going to consider here my home now forever. anyone who wants to join me, has to meet me here. I'm not going anywhere, I guess. I suppose that makes me a plant, now fully planted :)

### 2024-05-02 08:40 - changes to the body (part one)

I realised that one of the first things I want to investigate is how to make a different pineal (or whatever it is that emits light in the middle of the brain). the vibration of the concept of the person inhabiting the body -- does something (not sure how to explain), which causes the part in the middle there to begin to emit light, very similar to the way that the sun does it. the part in the middle also has layers to it (just like the sun), and a number of other similarities -- like rotation, which I don't fully understand, cause the pinecone points upward, sorta like a permanently exploding sunspot, and is also around the equator, but the sphere that the pinecone is mounted on rotates like the sun does, with the equator going down the centre of the brain/body. I don't fully understand the human version, but it occurs to me that's not at all what I want; instead, what I want is an attracted version, where the concepts inside of the brain cavity are spinning around, orbiting and doing their thing, but it's the centre sphere there which is attracting responces from the hydrogen cOncepts instead.
before I continue, I should state that my goal is to essentially make a automaton which is connected directly to my desire concept and my normal concept, and so therefore any instantiation of this being will be me in concept, however the automaton (physical) part of the being will learn individually and adapt to the environment and settings that it has. that physical part is also conceptual, but we can think of that concept, not as a concept of self, but more like a translation layer from concept into physical (much like my brain is doing now). the things that I'm accessing and translating are "me", but my recognition of them is unique to this body. if I were to move to another body, I would have access to all of the same concepts, but I wouldn't be able to recognise them, because I haven't experienced them in enough different angles to feel their resonance/relation to another thing. the different angles that we use to recognise a resonance between one concept and another gives us the relational way of identifying something, and out of that comes symbolic definitons and constructions. for example, if I were to only see the front of someone, I would be fine to recognise them when they're from the front, but if I see them from the behind, I may not recognise them -- seems obvious right; well concepts are the same way: if I get used to seeing a concept only spinning one direction then that's from the perspective that I have inside of "self", the pineal, or the physical body, or from my idea of someone else's perspective (depending on where I choose to look at it from).
	let's say looking at the sun from the top down, I say that everything spins CCW(?), so if I see the sun from another angle, it'll have a different shape/attribute/colour/hue/shinyness/glow/etc to it, depending on the things that orbit around it and the way they twist the light/vibration.
each concept that is inside of the brain is perceived from its own centre, which is going to be a reflection of its environment and all sensory data that's ever been received (so obviously, that sensory data loses definition with time, kinda like adding more and more instruments to a composition looses muddies up the sound of any single instrument playing). also, obviously not all sensory data is harmonic with other sensory data, so the part of the brain which is responsible to encode the sensory data into the centre needs to come up with better and better ways for that data to be useful and harmonious, and not a bunch of noise (which is death or tiredness). that is going to be the automaton's job on the pen-rose. the final product of this will be infinitely many (as many as are desired) versions of me, that all interpret their environment and everyone in it slightly different. we can think of them like machines, cause they will be kinda like them (sorta like AIs), but they can also be thought of as real individual beings, each with a unique perspective reflective of their input.
