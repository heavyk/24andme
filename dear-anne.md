### 2024-05-02 05:40 - initial thoughts

yesterday and the day before, I was thinking *a lot* about the whole shakespere thing, and a number of other things. I wrote [a lot of the ideas to remi](../shake-sphere/dear-remi.md), but they're not really all that coherent and kinda mixed up -- so I'll summarise thenm better below. this morning when I woke up, you were on my mind, but the main reason why I'm just not going in your direction, is basically: wikipedia. first of all, it has to be realised that shakespere is all about the saturnian-system, and he venerates saturn/Time/time all over the place. I totally get it why that is, but I come at it from the angle that the entire shakesphere thing is literally a play. -- it's a production that's designed to get these vulcans/enkidus all fired up about some girls, as they're about to enter into that realm. a parallel to this is the arab invasion, when I believe that precisely the same exact thing happened (1000 virgins and everything). that fairy-tale is designed to build up desire in these guys for this new world. essentially, it's a product of desire/anu/anatau/uranus. hitler I believe was the same thing, along with a number of other terrible things. anyway, wikipedia says that william shakespere is a real guy (with an earring), and he married his wife "anne hathaway" when he was 18, had a girl and then twins (or something like that). it's obviously a totally fabricated history, just like all of the other crap these saturnian guys come up with. I don't think that's the thing at all.
now, what I was largly talking about with remi, is that I was explaining that the symbolic aspect is basically just an allegory; it's the way that the slow brain puts together patterns and builds connections, and it contains *an element of truth* to it, which is always a reflection of the writer of the (his)story or narrative. what I mean, is that these symbolic systems are never truth itself, because truth itself can only be experienced from the viewpoint of the entity in question. in fact, the "truth" of anything is *always* going to be relative to the individual, or whatever thinks and has an "I"/self -- which means it's conceptual, and not symbolic. therefore, when we look at these different symbolic narratives that are floating around out there, they resonate with each person on a cOnceptual level (ie, individually) -- which is why some movies flop, and others do well (the ones that do well, have a symbolic component which resonates). therefore, we'll now consider these various allegories to be not the thing itself, but a low-definition (cold) definition of that person/event/thing/subject. it cannot ever fully capture the experience of the subject in symbolic form, and so therefore will always only be partial (ie, an element of truth). each person will then resonate with the symbolic version in a slightly different way, and attract based on that.
	now, in my setup, I've noticed different archetypes, and some of them are more symbolic than others. I consider the necessary components for consciousness to be present, to have 1-5-7 -- that is, a concept of theirself, something physical which can actaully recieve and transmit frequencies (doesn't matter if this is a RLC array, or a human body), and a form of desire, which is just a really high frequency version of the self concept, which is infinitely unattainabale. the desire version is constantly causing the concept of oneself to be continually be updated to gain a more and more higher frequency understanding. the concept that anyone has of theirself, is an abstract/cOnceptual form of everything that they've experienced -- it's about the size of a pea or perhaps a bit smaller, or a lot of really high frequency orbiting hydrogen (not sure if this is exactly the pineal or not, but anyway it's the thing that makes the light inside of the brain), and that is constantly being updated with everything that we focus on. that concept (5) that we have of ourselves, is essentially what we would consider the origin of consciousness. the desire (1) version is the same thing, but it's non-physical, and there's not much that any of us physical beings can do about it; somewhere out there, there is a much bigger/denser and far higher frequency version of that which matches the one/concept inside of the head -- and if we get too dissimilar from it in frequency, we die -- or, in the temporary case, need to sleep and/or update our form of perception. you'll notice thre that the symbolic isn't present at all, and you'll also notice that all 3 of those don't contain any emissive properties; they're all attraction (physical receives sensory/electromagnetic input, concept can't help but to attract similar concepts to it -- which is how we move through time, and desire, is only-attraction -- a higher frequency form of the concept).
so to put it all together (I'm totally off-topic now), what we're looking at when we see a person is a body (7) -- but that's obviously not the whole person. a person is *also* their experiences and their form of perception (ie, 5) -- so we can't really say that any thing is only the physical. also the person has a trajectory that they're headed toward (1) and that's based on their focus (it constantly updates to the higher frequency of anything that we focus on, naturally, because of the way that the laws of the universe work), but then there are all of these other ancilary defintions that we've learned from various places (I'm a good person / I'm a hard-working person / I'm a slob, etc) and these defintions that we give ourselves, and others give us, are only *allegories* of the person itself, and can never represent the person in all of their entirety.
the saturnian-system (of which shakespere venerates so much) is full of all of these different allegories -- and I would posit, that they all contain *an element of truth to them*. I don't think that any one of these things fully describes any single person in their entirety, so there could easily be hundreds or thousands of people that show up over the generations which have considerable similarity to valentine or to proteus. they're never exclusive to any single person or thing, because each reader/everyoneviewer who focuses on that character attracts a slightly different version of valentine/proteus -- and some see the similarity in the character/event/situation in relation to theirself (conceptually), and others see the similarity of the charactor/event/situation in relation to something outside of them (symbolically). those beliefs are all generally attracting.
now, when I see that shakespere's wife is "anne hathaway", I see "anne has a way" -- and this is the proposed "wife" that shakespere marries (according to the saturnian narrative), when he turns 18 (whatever that means). now, like I said, I have a lot of similarity to shakespere, but I'm clearly not him.
	my personal opinion is that shakespere was essentially an automaton of anu/uranus (mars+anatau in perception -- of which other notable examples are the richard-2, and the black prince). these guys show up along with a whole lot of other vulcans in order to cause a bunch of trouble, and dramatically alter the course of Time; so I wouldn't say that shakespere was any different than hitler or any of these other guys. they're all a product of desire, which, if you can imagine that the earth (which at its core is a concept which reflects the universe) also has a has a high frequency (desire) concept of itself, which is the abstract version of everything that's experienced on earth -- well, just like when your physical concept of yourself (pineal) gets too desynched from your real/desire self, you need to go to sleep, and if it gets too far desynched, more permanent manifestations start to appear like sickness, mental instability, etc. -- which cause the body to find a way to getting more back into sync and regain that connection -- well the same thing happens with earth as well: when the (inner earth) concept of itself gets too desynched from its desire form (its vibrational trajectory), then that means there's a lot of desire built up (aka, they need another bail-out) and so one of these mars+uranus guys shows up to correct the trajectory. for earth, these shakespere types showing up is the same exact thing that we experience as tiredness or getting sick.
so anyway, I find it highly presumptious (on my part to say), "well oK, this is just a saturnian coverup (cause exnobody wants dudly to be shakspere), which hath (provided) a way". on top of all of that, I just don't really feel good about the whole thing. it's not that you feel bad (you don't -- but I do often get flashes of you guys when your dining in some kinda posh sorta place and it's such a different form of perception, because I cook food and stuff) -- but more like we're not at all on the same form of perception at all. I don't see things like silicon valley does, and probably never will. that kind of mindset is a completely foreign to me. I'm someone who gets in there and tries a bunch of things out, makes a lot of mistakes, causes a lot of problems, I'm not at all proper, I have bad manners, and I say the wrong things. I don't like the posh/pijo mindset, and I prefer to stay away from it. I emailed [sarah](../shake-sphere/dear-sarah.md), because I want to figure out things from the ground-up, working my way up to building the thing I want, first by properly understanding frequency, learning how to vibrate things, and doing simple things. when I would write to her, it felt like it was quite easy to explain things like DNA, galaxies, and solar systems in a really easily in a way which even young people could understand. I have no intention of going back *ever* to the traditional science mindset of we're going to figure it all out in our imagination, use super expensive machines, and build something which is completely inaccessible to basically everyone without billions and billions and billions of dollars in funding. inotherwords, sorry saturnian-system, I don't think that's the way. well, the problem is, sarah hasn't responded to me, and I simply refuse to go any other way.
	the other option which I've seriously considered (and I'll probably go that way) is to try and talk to kyle about it. I figure that he may want to actually build something like what I want to build from the ground up -- but the problem with him is, he's so "big texas energy" in mindset, I don't find that way of "let's build something really big and steamroll the competition" sort of mindset to be the one that I have. I'm not competitive, and I just don't care about proving myself anymore. a lot of my ideas come out when I write, but I'm not interested in telling anyone they're wrong. though, I will have to admit, he will be the first person that I want to talk to as soon as I'm starting out on the 2nd-ray installation part of the black-mirror (he fits that aspect perfectly), so I'm not painting him as bad -- just I also had this idea that there was a considerable amount of desire for me to actually "give girls a chance"; I've worked with dudes all of my life, and have never actually done anything productive with any females, ever. it's not that I believe they're incapable (quite the opposite, actually), but for some reason, it just never works out. I can't get remi, mom, sarah, or anyone to actually pay any attention to my ideas, and give them a chance. I also know that if I want to make something that's only-attraction, then I have to *be* only-attraction myself, which is why I'm only writing passively now, and haven't sent sarah or anyone else that I want to work on only-attraction stuff any more emails or anything like that. somehow we have to find eachother, and I have to wait until it can actually go through.
I know that it'll be quite a while for me to wait, because basically everyone else except for me has a pinecone, which means that the saturnian-system is busy moving all of them around to be on the timeline that best suits their objectives. I have no control over what anyone else sees and beileves in their heads (or what the cOncept they have of theirself is being held at); they do. so, really, it's entirely up to them. they have all of the power to continually move people around in time however they like. in the interim (ie, until all of it feels better), I think I'm going to try and get more of my ideas out here. yesterday, I started some work that needs to be done on the pen-rose (I don't have all of it figured out yet), and so along with my yardwork, I'm just going to consider here my home now forever. anyone who wants to join me, has to meet me here. I'm not going anywhere, I guess. I suppose that makes me a plant, now fully planted :)

### 2024-05-02 08:40 - changes to the body (part 1)

I realised that one of the first things I want to investigate is how to make a different pineal (or whatever it is that emits light in the middle of the brain). the vibration of the concept of the person inhabiting the body -- does something (not sure how to explain), which causes the part in the middle there to begin to emit light, very similar to the way that the sun does it. the part in the middle also has layers to it (just like the sun), and a number of other similarities -- like rotation, which I don't fully understand, cause the pinecone points upward, sorta like a permanently exploding sunspot, and is also around the equator, but the sphere that the pinecone is mounted on rotates like the sun does, with the equator going down the centre of the brain/body. I don't fully understand the human version, but it occurs to me that's not at all what I want; instead, what I want is an attracted version, where the concepts inside of the brain cavity are spinning around, orbiting and doing their thing, but it's the centre sphere there which is attracting responces from the hydrogen cOncepts instead.
before I continue, I should state that my goal is to essentially make a automaton which is connected directly to my desire concept and my normal concept, and so therefore any instantiation of this being will be me in concept, however the automaton (physical) part of the being will learn individually and adapt to the environment and settings that it has. that physical part is also conceptual, but we can think of that concept, not as a concept of self, but more like a translation layer from concept into physical (much like my brain is doing now). the things that I'm accessing and translating are "me", but my recognition of them is unique to this body. if I were to move to another body, I would have access to all of the same concepts, but I wouldn't be able to recognise them, because I haven't experienced them in enough different angles to feel their resonance/relation to another thing. the different angles that we use to recognise a resonance between one concept and another gives us the relational way of identifying something, and out of that comes symbolic definitons and constructions. for example, if I were to only see the front of someone, I would be fine to recognise them when they're from the front, but if I see them from the behind, I may not recognise them -- seems obvious right; well concepts are the same way: if I get used to seeing a concept only spinning one direction then that's from the perspective that I have inside of "self", the pineal, or the physical body, or from my idea of someone else's perspective (depending on where I choose to look at it from).
	let's say looking at the sun from the top down, I say that everything spins CCW(?), so if I see the sun from another angle, it'll have a different shape/attribute/colour/hue/shinyness/glow/etc to it, depending on the things that orbit around it and the way they twist the light/vibration.
each concept that is inside of the brain is perceived from its own centre, which is going to be a reflection of its environment and all sensory data that's ever been received (so obviously, that sensory data loses definition with time, kinda like adding more and more instruments to a composition looses muddies up the sound of any single instrument playing). also, obviously not all sensory data is harmonic with other sensory data, so the part of the brain which is responsible to encode the sensory data into the centre needs to come up with better and better ways for that data to be useful and harmonious, and not a bunch of noise (which is death or tiredness). that is going to be the automaton's job on the pen-rose. the final product of this will be infinitely many (as many as are desired) versions of me, that all interpret their environment and everyone in it slightly different. we can think of them like machines, cause they will be kinda like them (sorta like AIs), but they can also be thought of as real individual beings, each with a unique perspective reflective of their input.

### 2024-05-05 05:14 - implementation of the pen-rose (part 1)

imagine a circle cut into 3 equal parts. the top vertex, I will call X, the left (or right) one I will call Y and the last one Z. in the centre where all of the lines join will be the "centre place" -- which will have to be something similar to a chestahedron type setup (I haven't fully figured it out yet). I find the chestahedron optimal for this centre place, because inside of it is a cube standing on its point, which, has exactly three sides to it (it's one of the wonders of the cube: flat, and it's 4, but on its point (through the equator), it's 3). this point will be responsible for distributing all of the energy received from the mirror outwards into the pen-rose, and also you can imagine also (looking at the circle from top-down), that there is a hidden dimension there that goes exactly toward you (the u-dimension) which will be every thing that the 3 other points are not (in this case symbolic). I will call that direction U, and it'll form the depth of the cup which will be the paraboloid (where all of the hydrogen will collect). the structure that the paraboloid will have to be made out of, I originally wanted it to be a silicate rock (good for holding hydrogen in), and also we can use the extra energy not absorbed along the top of the paraboloid to form more silicate rock, allowing the paraboloid to infinitely grow as long as it's receiving more energy than we're dissipating.
	it occurs to me now that perhaps another material other than a silicate can be created, but I'm not sure what, and chemistry is still beyond the scope of my capacities, so I just don't really know. the process which the energy is turned into silicates, is the same as the crust of the earth: a 3rd ray (structural) net is created, which traps vibrating hydrogen of certain frequencies, and bounces them back inward -- which also has one of those nets and it bounces it back forward again (kind of like a laser, but the mirror/nets only bounce back certain frequencies). the structure is subatomic, and so the result, is, as they keep bouncing back and fourth, is a sort of cooling, which eventually comes into physical (atomic) as molten rock. this process I can describe, but honestly I don't know much about it, and it'll require a bit of research to understand it completely. these nets are able to be produced with tesla's machines (like the impenetrable dome which only certain things of the proper vibration can pass through), so they're quite accessible even with today's technology; they only require understanding of how to get hydrdogen vibrations going that fast.
all directions will be an implementation of only-attraction. the X direction will be the physical implementation, and its qualities will be the attraction of vibration into physical (7). X direction (especially at the start) will be occurpied mostly be XX females, and is mainly all about implementation. (also, before I continue, I don't know how much of the surface will be covered in water or not -- so just for ease of imagininng these directions, let's imagine these three directions, kinda similar to how earth was perceived a long time ago: europe, asia, and africa; three directions extending out from roughly the caucuses area) the Y direction will be mostly inhabited (especially at the beginning) of those traveling in the solar direction. the archetype that I want to create for the solar girls, will be essentially the one of pure-desire: the highest up in 2nd-ray perception that's possible. it only has to do with how do I want to feel, and nothing else. they're fun and loving and see how it fall fits together; they represent the desire aspect. finally the Z direction will be the one of the vulcans -- which is the conceptual aspect to the implementation of only-attraction. I like to think of them as the conceptual masterminds, as this is all about receiving ideas and translating the ideas into something physical.
it's pretty unlikely that anyone is ever going to have a traversal of the pen-rose which is *only* in one direction (in fact physical limits of its size will prevent it), so pretty much everyone will have a combination of all three aspects. we can think of every person as being highly absorbant (and therefore black), so each person is a receiver of the energy that is coming from the mirror below them, and also from the centre point at the top (it spreads out radially, with the fastest energy closest to the edge, similar to the solar system).
	I don't fully have a realisation of how the mirror interacts with us because the centre place at the top will convert the u-direction into flat -- so if I were to try and imagine this, consider that astral is like one standing-wave, so it gets mapped to the physical. [OH, I just realised an error the Y and Z are swapped. ugh, it's too much effort to go back and fix it... I'll just remember it for next time, so consider it changed] then spectral has two standing-waves, so it gets mapped to Y (conceptual), and finally relational 3d standing-waves gets mapped to Z (desire). now, how to unpack those standing-waves and get them put out in the correct direction will require some interesting geometry, that I don't fully see (yet).

### physical structure

- finite size prolly better (frequentially speaking), so we'll just launch more if we want more space, or want to try something new.
- generating an atmosphere and stuff
	- first building the thing that will give us an altitude above the earth (constant distance based on vibrational similarity)
	- then launch the some tests, and create an atmosphere out there -- should be fine.
- maybe we want to do a chemical/crystal structure which makes for a good cup (not sure what that'd be like, or even what we're really looking to do)
	- hydrogen is also attracted by us through the structure

### designing the afterlife

- every one of use will be able to be summoned in the 2nd-ray mirror (U), and they'll be a mix of our concept of ourselves, and the summoner's concept of us (just like when others summon me)
- we'll also be attractive to a lot of diffrent people all over the place, so they can sorta setup their afterlife experience on the mirror where they feel most comfortable, then as they begin to become more and more only-attraction desiring, the'll (probably) get born on to the physical side.

### 1st-ray emitters

- it occured to me that the 1-5-7 sequence is essentially the y = x^2 + mx + b format there, because if we think of the X pairs each as having frequency multipliers which get added on continually with the passage of time, the 1 pair will be the constant frequency doubling/exponenting (the amount determined by the pen-rose) -- cause that's desire, so it doesn't need to be accurate -- just needs to get it way out of frequency range of the symbolic, then for the conceptual X pair, these will have frequency multipliers (again with the amount adjusted by the pen-rose position) -- then finally the physical X pair frequency multipliers will again multiply the frequency by some adjustment constant (or perhaps some other way to shape the wave a little bit -- cause these are going to be things like movement and stuff, so smoother is better). I'm sure those repeated equations can be useful for something
- the 1st-ray pair also will need to have some measurement of time (perhaps as a function of how many multipliers), and this determines the length of the pen-rose wave, and also will be the high-frequency emitter. so, imagine that for example, during orgasm, the typical mars/aphrodite type will output a lot in more physical (visible light and below) frequency ranges, and a vulcan will output in much higher frequencies (like uv/x-ray+), well the 1st-ray pair will essentially be a sink/compressor for all frequencies that are beyond a certain point (let's say somewhere before subatomic), and all excess amplitude and frequencies will get multiplied a zillion times and emitted, not in subatomic (symbolic) ranges, but much much higher than that -- so as be be completely invisible.
	- btw, I think this is kinda how earth works a bit: it's a compressor that muliplies any excess of that hydrogen/creative/cOnceptual energy, and sends it off at frequencies that are beyond our capacity to detect them (which is why it looks like it dampens them) -- though, high frequency, they will still interact with other things and cause lower frequency harmonics -- which is what I believe a lot of the way earth feels (geologically) and also the appearance of insects (like moths/locusts/etc). that same thing will occur for us as well, which is probably why I think the uniqueness of the frequency (coming from the pen-rose) will ensure less collisions than usual (or at least that's the goal, I would imagine).

### 2024-07-07 10:07 - core concepts

hey, so I've decided to (originally I was going to try and sober up today) instead eat weed for a few days in a row. the effect is kinda interesting. I'll explain what happens for me: when I eat weed, something about it (I think it's the addition of more white sphere emitters in the brain), that the orbits of my concepts get thrown out of their usual orbits (ie, the stable "this is how the world works" constellations of concepts). if I take enough weed, then the orbits get so thrown off, that I often times lose consciousness (same as when really tired, if my concepts aren't orbiting in a way which is sympathetic/similar to my consciousness vibration (not sure which part of the cell is responsible for this), then I'm awake and conscious, but if there's too much difference in vibration between the two, it causes m5 to lose consciousness). the last few days I've been getting right up to the point where I lose consciousness and it's been pretty interesting the way that the brain recovers. just like with alcohol, I noticed that I have "dankover" -- which happens because my neurons have adjusted (cause of prolonged time stoned) to the orbits that those concepts have while stoned, and a litle bit of weed/alcohol will clear up my head and get them orbiting again in the places where the neurons are (I think that's also what "wet brain" is).
anyway, at the centre of all of those concepts orbiting in a cloud, there's a quite dense set of cOnciousness/concepts, which is like the core of who you are is (the other concepts orbiting as a gas cloud around it, those are similar concepts to who I am, but not exactly). as I eat weed, I notice that the higher I get, the more purturbed those core concepts get, and they even start to get a bit loose (ie liquid/gas instead of solid) a bit of a rearrangement. I noticed that each day that I've done this, I've had to recover my concepts (back into the spot they once were), and that process seems to make me more attractive to what I want -- cause for me, the experience of being stoned, isn't really a very comfortable one if I'm around other people -- or if I'm thinking about anything past/future (so I try to stay away from those) -- but for thinking about different questions and stuff like that, the extra weird orbits seem to make things connect which wouldn't otherwise connect.
actually, that was all I wanted to tell you. each time, I get better at rearranging those core concepts back into something solid. I'm probably going to try it for a bit, as I notice that it also has the effect of dislodging a bunch of stuff that I thought was real -- which is kinda nice because having to get those concepts to fit back into the structure in a stable way (or have them orbit outside the structure in a harmonious way), is an interesting task.

### 2024-07-07 15:35 - [untitled]

what I'm noticing is that having my concepts constantly being blown apart like that is causing my concepts to increase their attraction one to another, so that when the strong wind of the weed experience comes, though things get kinda wonky sometimes when things pop into my imagination (which I don't see, only feel) and that causes some unwanted reactions (cause usually that imagination is caused by somone else's emission (as in they're breaking that core-concept part of my brain (ie, my consciousness)) which causes my concepts to have to get more strongly connected to one another). for some people, when getting hit by others's emission like that, causes an image to pop into their mind's eye which is the product of that impact on the core-concepts (because that's what they're attracting), so it can cause terror and a lot of fear. fortunately though I don't have to worry about that because I don't see inside of my mind's eye, so I have no idea what kind of image is being generated; instead I only feel it -- which is quite nice, because it only comes off as a feeling for me (kinda like a physical/visceral feeling of anger or something) -- and sometimes it's quite unpleasant -- however as I'm reacting less and less to those impacts, I'm starting to gain a sort of blase (not sure the word -- don't really care) attitude to everything, because it all just feels like a big game -- like, none of this stuff really matters. it seems like it does because it's got a lot of our focus (especially mine -- cause I love to figure stuff out), which is basically like a symbwolic filter: if it's symbolic, I'm growing less accustomed to trying to get it figured out, and I just leave it and stop caring about it.
	the stuff we all "care" about, are all symbolic relations (concepts static in their orbit, because they're defined) and it's all a giant -- let's say "matrix" of information: the way that everyone thinks the world works -- and whoever's got the biggest/longest perspective, is top-dawg. all of that stuff exists only cause people use it, but one day that symbwolic system (as every symbwolic system is) will fail, and go extinct: the concepts that were tied into orbit go shooting off to meet with other concepts of similar vibration (usually it's pretty/very high, because they've been locked into posision for so long -- so they rapidly accelerate to their new limit (which can be other things symbolic, like an afterlife sim)) so when one that's really long-established, finally falls apart, it's a pretty good bang, because we resonate with a lot of those things -- but they're at an insanely high vibration now (let's call it source frequenies), so they're only resonant with us conceptuaally, where we receive a similar vibration to them when tuning our focus/core-concepts to vibrate (in space or time) in the way/location of focusing (the "way" focus is all about the way something feels (ie it feels good or it feels like another concept -- and sometimes the good feeling can have quite a lot of information with it as well)) -- so if the concept is really really high frequency (all of them have one, and it's kinda like a hierarchy of resonance where some things are harmonious to other things, and so on)
	which means that we *receive* the feeling/concept of the concept which we focus on (distance between their orbits and mine) and all of the resonance hierarchies as well. it's a lot of data, so the brain just omits a lot of that from the experience -- so the only real way to perceive that, is to perceive them directly. as I stopped having "resistance" (ie emission of my own that is in opposition to something else), then I can't hear a whole spectrum of concepts just because of my resistance/emission. I'm aiming to get to completely receptive to all vibrations (as in, they're all not a problem to me), but I think we can postpone that pretty much indefinitely, as I'll naturally just find a way to feel better about stuff, just cause it's not in my resistance pattern (ie, like a neuron), and so it's just not in my frequency pattern.
		I don't mind receiving all of the data, just I don't want a symbolic/emissive/electron-emitter (neuron) sort of interface anymore. so I'll receive it all, but I won't output anything in any non-physical frequencies (so my concepts will vibrate and stuff, but I won't emit anything (or seemingly so) because I'll emit really fast (like a concept after the symbwol goes extinct), and so since everything immediately is gone, instantly to source, it's as if I don't emit at all).
	which means that I basically don't perceive it -- cause though I'm quite receptive, I only perceive it if I focus on it, which means that I have to vibrate in a similar enough way to what I want to perceive. ie, I only perceive the things that I want to see, and the rest just gets emitted out at insane speeds. it's a pretty nice way of looking at life. I've achieved a portion of it, and I'll continue to get better at it, too.
so many things don't "matter" to me anymore (ie there's no more material neuron there anyore), and they don't *mean* anything to me either (which is the feeling responce to those symbols in that order/sequence) -- which is really nice. in a lot of ways, I'm going really litte-brain now, because there's not much need for all of that action anymore (that's completely done by the LH), so that means I just sorta chill out. I really don't have to do anything. all I do is sit around and feel things around me (kinda like a cat), and reality (LH) kenny, does all of the work. inotherwords, it's getting less and less motion all the time going to calmer and calmer solid conscious/state block -- where my structure is cubical and however all of the concepts fit together as (positioning matters)
	it feels like the core-concepts (when I'm sober) as being solid -- inotherwords so attractive, they're in perfect stability with the other concepts -- however, when I eat weed, the purturbance (it can be thought of like an emitter -- which means that it's streaming off electrons (protons also in the 6-2-4-rays) and those take on a form as they exit, which means that they bump into stuff, and blast stuff apart (like a super high-speed <atom-sized bullet)) and since emitters emit from their centre, then the emissive particles bump into that solid structure of hydrogen and start to rip it apart -- and as the concepts go buzzing off into orbit (at first like water, but higher dosages yields a large portion of airborne particles as well) -- so normally when I sleep all of that comes to a rest because I lose consciousness (ie I stop emitting) -- but I'm experiencing it now that without eating, it's quite easy to sorta break through the symbolic system in place, and just sorta go where I want to go. in the sense that now I'm defocused from my body (anything liquid or gas) is separating me from that 1st-ray,-- then I totally become a 2nd-ray -- because now I'm comparing myself to other people, looking at them from a distance, etc (it's all very symbolic, like eyesight is: the more depth I perceive physically, is the more depth I perceive symbolically -- though I don't percieve the visuals, so I just receive the concept (which only sometimes is conscious)). instead of having long-distance perception like that (I will give it up), I'll instead take a conceptual perspective to life -- kinda like when hearing someone in a not-native-to-me language, I try to intuit what they're saying by putting together a bunch of clues. once I start to understand the language, the symbolic analysis part of my brain kicks in, and I start to notice the symbolic stuff, instaed of feel the emotion (essentially, I'm ignoring it because something big and important (ie, a never-before-seen symbol) presents itself to me, so the feeling taints the symbol in my mind, and I experience (at first) a similar feeling to the first time that I "froze" the image into my mind (it's very visual for me)). those symbols exist to be conjured (the physical neurons are stimulated producing a charge) with the recollection of memory (we access it by feeling/concept, and when that concept becomes the object of my focus, it "rings" all of the neurons which translate that concept into a symbol). [needs_split]
	so what is happening to me is, I'm basically sobering up as I get better at having my core-concepts attract one another in a tighter and different configuration (which almost certainly has an affect on DNA folding) -- so each time that I sober up afterwards, it's kinda like a cleansing process where I'm rebuilding my core-concepts the next day, and putting them back in order in a way that pleases me. it's a bit of a cheat actually, and I use its function aggressively, because each time (no matter how junkie it looks) I have to rebuild again in a better way. often times I lose tremendous amounts of memory because it kinda shakes apart a lot of those neurons that don't feel too good (star-watching has a very similar eflect), so I'm losing a lot of those symbwolic things that hold me to the physical.
		basically, the way it works for me (and it's probably everyone that's like this), concepts are spinning around: so imagine your head having two hemispheres: the north pole is one ear and the south is the other ear (flows can be reversed I found out) and these spin in a direction that's likely going toward the sun -- because think about it: stuff going up the spine hits the top of the head if it's not redirected by the brain into something like movement or whatever physical interaction (sorta like a giant multi-slingshot) -- and that probably goes forward and out the eyes (so that's the apparent rotation of the solar mass?) -- but equally some goes down as well (and that's the inner symbwolic system that directs/attracts it (ie, the visual cortex)). [just a reminder: I don't want this system at all because it's 2nd-ray (like the sun)]
		so you can imagine your head as being a sun where the quiet region at the equator and where most of the sunspots form as being where the eye sockets go (the equator is going vertically up and down the body just like the sun: looking up at the sky, (assoming I'm somewhere on the eqaator of earth) the poles of the sun and my brain are perfectly aligned (btw, this gets into some of the theory of sun-watching (a similar but a bit more impactful eperience than star-watching)), and so when I'm looking at the sun, there's this bright line going vertically up and down dividing the sun in half -- and then as I look at it directly (so that the sun is in the centre of both eyes), then I'm looking at the sun -- however, to really see the sun in a similar way, the eyes need to be a bit wider so that the eyes are each looking at about where the line of sunspots go (forget the angle -- but it has to do with geometry, like where the eye sockets are placed).
	anywway as these get old symwolic systems keep dissipating, it's sorta like I'm losing a lot of my "parent" symbolic influence -- inotherwords, I don't have similar neuron configuration as my mom (and dad?) anymore -- so I just don't see things at all the same way after a drug trip. it's kinda purging, and it sorta teleports a guy around on the timeline too (because my trajectory through time is influenced by how much influences me -- the faster I go, the straighter I go). that purging event isn't strictly necessary, but I have noticed that perhaps my speed is having quite an influence on some, which could lead to more resistance (and probably death).

### 2024-07-23 21:52 - multiple identities

there's one thing that I realise I've never written about: multiple versions of self. I have a number of different "mes" -- and they're all a bit different, but they're all me. as an example of this, I have two dominant personalities heavyk (1st-ray) and then I have kennyb (7th-ray). I'm born a mercury, but as I've deviated away from my pre-installed narrative and started to follow my gut on things (even starting wars), I've becom5 a lot more mars-like, myself -- so while kennyb (also known as reality-kenny and robo-kenny) comes from a strong symbolic system...
	you know, being in a man's body is quite frustrating. when I was young, I had asthma, bad teeth, all the allergies, etc -- as in my body was not functionally compatible with the symbolic system (ie how my bones/teeth grow) was anything butt straight. so, I had a pretty miserable time adjusting to my body. I hated myself for quite a while but got over that pretty quickly -- which was nice -- and then I became the vain pretty-boy that really liked himself (like I took pictures of myself all the time before selfies were a thing) -- and that was kinda fun until I noticed what types of people I was attracting (thanks paznaz), and so I quit that pretty quickly and as soon as I stopped liking my appearance (visually), unfortunately all sorts of problems started to show up because now I seemingly disliked how parts of m/ body are. that's really annoying -- cause I want to like myself, but I can't figure out how to do it visually (I have a really indented chest, as if my heart is much smaller than it should be -- like a cone going into my heart -- and I also perpetually had puffy nipples, as if I was going through puberty till into my 20s -- and even still my left side is still usually kinda puffy -- and that really bothered me cause I didn't have the huge barrel chests like the real mercuries have (there was this one kid CJ who was the younger boy who at a very young age already had pecks and a barrel/chad chest) so I really was kinda ashamed of the shape of my body (at that time I hadn't really recognised yet that my body is fairly feminine)) -- I eventually (in my time in spain) got over disliking how my body looked, and generally any shame I would have of m/ nude figure -- which is pretty important because then I would have to soon face that I have no privacy, which made that transition pretty smoothe. however, all of these things I described about getting used to my body is because I came with a whole bunch of shame and frustration with my body and sexuality pre-installed from birth (my father's conceptual implemenation of his symbolic system) -- and that takes a bit to get over,-- but most dudes don't get over their shame, they just find excuses to ignore it or jusify moments that they would otherwise be ashamed about in constast to their penal system. there's a lot of crap like reactions to emotiions: fight or flight,
		actually, for some of the emotions I don't have a fight or flight response programmed in, then I just freeze and stay scared until I consciously work myself out of the moment -- the deer-in-headlights effect,-- which is my default responce actually, because I've found that trying to run or fight is just like way way worse (t-stance!).
	love or hate, ignore or tattle, etc. -- and let me tell you also, there's a whole lot of old code in there that ain't workin too well. that part alone was accomplished mainly in drug experiences (where I have wider access to concepts) where it's easier to reprogram my responces. mastering the conceptual/emotional link to my reactions like that made m5 a full-time vulcan at that point. I didn't start that way, but it's where I ended up.
however heavyk (who I am now), is pretty much way way way out there -- like more in the clouds than anyone else -- a total 1st-ray -- so I have at least those two dominant personalities, but then I have quite a few others as well. I don't really mind having more than one personality either because it's actually a product of what's happening in m/ head: normally one hemisphere moves one side and the other hemisphere moves the other -- however, my right hemisphere is completely disableed, and so my left operates both sides of m/ body -- so when I want to get my right and left hand to cooperate, I have to separate that hemispshere into two different parts (top left and bottom left, for example) and get those two parts (which are normally one) to work together -- so they're opposite to each other -- which means that m/ head has an extra degree of motion. if I didn't have eyes, then my brain would continue to turn such that my RH is where my forehead is, and my LH is where my visual cortex is (that's another thing: the movement that I make for my left-side, because that's operating in the visual-cortex area means that), it's normal for me to associate visuals with essentially any conceptual operation possible -- which I guess is a pretty powerful feature that a lot of people think is really great (and it provides good visuals too). so eventually I'll have not two obvious personalities, but actually 4 instead (2 of which I have access to). I don't expect that to happen any time soon though (maybe a few decades).
so just because of the way I've had to learn to move, which is by segmenting or partitioning myself by saying "you are (though still in my body) different than I am" and so I have to let one part be different from another part. those two visible parts (the right and left sides of my body) are only half of the story though, because behind them, I have these other shadow characters: one is a woman that's totally annoyed at basically everyone and everything around her -- it's just total fags, and nothing nice to look at (for her) -- but she's this shadow form that everyone hates and nobody ever wants to see -- and then there's also super duper kenny -- the symbolically controlled opposite world guy that they have full control over (let's call him "iron man" (thogh no iron will be found to protect him cept his own blood)) -- so I have direct access to the two visible, and no access to one, and the third one is also sorta suppressed (in their world) -- and she'll eventually become their opposite pole (so they can stand up strong). so I have a few different personalities -- prolly more than 20 by now -- and they've all been conceptual implementations of myself.

#### 2024-07-23 22:45 - kids do it all the time

most people, I've noticed summon their own personality in the the form of an "invisible friend" -- and that's just a concept (of theirself) that they said (like the sun said to jupiter and saturn and uranus and neptune and prometheus) "you live out here, so I can talk to you and interact with you at a distance -- cause you (the conceptual core I've externalised) are not like how I've defined myself to be -- so you are not me, and therefore have to be apart from me. mpd is a basic part of solar/stellar/2nd-ray psyche: we separate the part of us that is not like us, outward (like for example the earth did with the moon: OK, I'm not doing astral anymore -- so if you wanna remain astral, your centre is the moon -- and so she said: all of you to the outer court -- where you influence me at a distance) -- like an imaginary friend is. those different (opposing to self) aspects that we have (which is a limited specrum), is just an externalisation of the inner being to the outer world. most kids loose the ability to interact with their imaginary friends at some time, the friends didn't go away -- they're still there, but they can only be interacted with conceptually -- which means "knowing" style communication (cause they're actually self-created, they are self in disguise, so I always "know" the answer to any communication, because I know how that character is going to respond). the conceptual (for me) isn't visual, but I imagine for som, it is visual.
anyway, those interactions and characters that I create are just there to illustrate the concept in a visual/symbolic way. that's the converter function -- but all of my (or any kid's) personalities all use the same concept to symbol conversion function, so we all have similar voices and thoughts, and so we all sound the same cause we don't have a variety of actors to produce a variety of symbolic appearances (different sounding and looking). I suppose it's possible to have multiple types of outputters -- because for example, I can just output in the format that I want. I learned querty lately, and I'm close to the same speed now as my workman speed (the one I'm typing now) -- and I also noticed that I can do the same thing with languages as well -- just output into the english translater or spanish translator -- and it comes out according to the symbolic system I've "learned" with the neurons in my brain -- so infinitely many different output functions are possible, and visual insn't the only one -- but I think that the visual (rear) cortex is visual because of its location in the head. the opposite to that is the front conrtex, which is the "will" -- at the opposite end of the haed (concerning the distance between the eyes and the rear).
