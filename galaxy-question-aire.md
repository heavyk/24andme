### 2024-03-30 14:26 - who can come with me?

I don't have any restrictions on who can come, and I even imagine that there will be some "stowaways". the thing is, it'll start to become so high energy (especially after leaving the solar system), that manifestation of thoughts and emotions will become essentially instant. to get around this rapidly increasing attraction (cause there won't be a sun or any 2nd-ray establishing the system), I have a number of different things that I want to do (of which I'm already a living prototype of many). thoughts will take on a whole new form; instead of thinking thoughts like we do now, thoughts will all become a translation of emotion into symbol. in fact, all symbolic things (words, actions, etc) will come never as a primary output, but *only* as a reflectoin or as a result of something else. symbol is necessary, but it's not going to drive any portion of our relational system. anyone who is in any way primary symbolic will find it very very very difficult to be on this galaxy.
	good examples of this are a lot of my conversations with greg and jaron about things that "mean" something, or are interpretted symbolically to be a certain way. there will be no laws or code of conduct, and definitely no cOntrol system to enforce it. all things are possible, and so anything that anyone thinks or feels will become reality basically instantly. to describe what it would be like, imagine a person that can *only* see what they want to see, hear what they want to hear, and do anything that they want to do -- and it'll be something like that. appearance will no longer matter (cause everyone sees what they want to see), and symbolic word presentation (order, inflection, and stuff like that) also will no longer make a difference either.
also, it's of note to say that some might consider going with us, to have a sort of tragic and amazing death experience. they'll find it probably pretty unlikely that they'll be able to become only-attraction (in their present form), but maybe they like the idea of it, and want to give it another shot in a new body. there are a lot of possiblities, but the essence of it all, is that the speeds we'll go at, everyone will have to come to terms (faster and faster) with their wildest desires and fears, at an increasing rate.
	personally, and although I know this sort of system is what I want, I don't at all see myself ready for it. I still have a lot of difficulties that I still have with my environment. sure a new environment with good conditions will solve the problem, *and* I'm also confident too that I'll be able to create solutions to all my difficulties in time, before my own attraction destroys me too, so I don't really consider it a drawback at all. inotherwords, because my desire is to be only-attraction and I have a willingness to change, improve, and become that, I'm confident that my desire is enough to ensure success. others though, who are less inclined to want to change, will surely destroy theirselves. I'm getting ahead of myself here, but when looking at this galaxy from the perspective that earth is the slowest and source is way way way out there at the fastest speed, we're going to be physical beings that are making a very fast (cause it's attracted) trip toward "certain death", or becoming non-physical source. it's a journey that ensures that death is the final outcome, and nobody will survive it (unless we can find a way to keep up with the ever increasing speeds, which I think is possible).
in order to make this whole ever-increasing speeds thing possible, I want to design new technology that will work in such a high energy environment, and can ensure and describe to everyone out with us, their distance from certain destruction (sorta like a health/resonance bar (with their source)). nobody is "perfect" and I don't expect them to be either, just constantly improving (like source)

### 2024-04-03 01:35 - what will it be like?

the funny thing about this question, and the reason why I've waited so long to answer it, is I don't really know. originally, when I had the flat-earth-idea, I found that to be quite tantalising, because it solved so many problems -- cept one: me, and my continually increasing vibration. my solution to that problem was genetics, where I'd take my continually rising speed and spread that speed increase out over infinite diversity on the pen-rose.
	presently though, I just don't see that happening. there's no way I'm going to be doing any genetics in the present situation, and also there's no way that I can get anyone to change. the reality is though, that my speed is continuing to increase (especially now that I've gone straight-edge) -- so since they're not going to be making and changes, and there's literally no way to get me to slow down at this point, the only solution is for me to get farther and farther away from the sun.
		assuming that I'm right about the being on pluto thing, noting the massive changes that I had in body weight (went from 110lbs to 130-135lbs in two days), and the differences in how my vision was, and also energy levels, I have to assume that the original intention of them bringing me here (I live in a completely artificial reality), was to get me farther away from the sun. it definitely worked for a while -- because I definitely felt the power level drop upon moving here, but I star-watched to get back to the limit again.
	the problem is, at this point, it's probably not far enough; so I either need to make may way out to an even farther out planet, or this one needs to take off. so really, I see this as kind of a sorta showdown between options: either someone steps up to the plate and wants to work on genetics with me (someone other than them, and probably not related to them, cause they definitely won't do it -- "them" is likely the antarctica guys: nosebook's top tier) -- *or*, energy rises to such a hight, that they have no option but to send me off. they could try and come with me (stowaways), but just like how it is right now, I only just have to wait it out, and that'll start to become uncomfortable for them too ("my eyes are bleeding, my soul is leaving here"). at that point, things will start to become really easy for me, because I'll just make things with my mind, and the technology to produce what I want to make will be easy
however, if I'm going to be heading out as a galaxy ("*another dimension*, new galaxy, intergalactic planetary"), I want to take all of the ideas that I had for flat-earth-idea and implement them out here instead. it'll actually work quite well, from I've been looking at. let me explain the black-mirror-idea now.
instead of the earth pointing its northern hemisphere at the sun to get such a powerful 2nd-ray input, we're going to need to get it from somewhere else. the idea will be to make one whole side of the planet as flat as possible (and perhaps even a bit concave). the opposite side of that will be a sort of dome, with the top of the mountain probably some sort of -- something I don't know how to describe, but it'll receive and be an attractor of 2nd-ray energy coming from stars and the sun. that will be the centre-place of the pen-rose, and out from there will go down the dome and out into the flat land. it's likely that a hole will need to be made from that to the core of the planet up to the pen-rose, because that's going to have an opposite pushing down effect to make the energy come out of the equator (like the rings of saturn). the lava tubes will have to be built so that rock continues to build up radially outward (no idea on how all of that will work yet), and that'll start to build out -- but instead of being flat, this the way these lava tubes will have to flow, it'll probably need to make a parabola. in the under concave of the parabola, lots and lots of hydrogen will continue to accumulate (like a toilet bowl) because our attraction all along the dome will be so great, it'll keep pulling in more and more from the rest of the universe. as we become more and more attractive, the hydrogen in the toilet bowl will get denser and denser, and start to form a very flat surface. also, it'll be pitch black as well, absorbing all frequencies (this is a property of hydrogen actually when it gets to very high densities).
many beings will live in and on the surface of this 2nd-ray reflector, and I'll have to imagine that it'll become the new "afterlife" place to be. those people will be both strongly attracted to us, and also a reflection of the universe -- a kind of in-between stage between only-attraction, and still a symbolic-first world. I find it quite likely that many of those souls will get pulled in to bodies and/or born on to the only-attraction side, as the only-attraction idea becomes more attractive to them.
the only-attraction (outer) side of the dome/cup/bowl will also feature the pen-rose, and on it will be lots and lots of people that are extremely attractive. I can't be too certain about this yet because I don't fully understand the genetics, but the way that it seems, females are quite able (much moreso than men) to be only-attraction, and so I don't imagine too much alteration will need to be made to their genetics. many of them, I think will feature y-chromosomes, and will be the vulcan style of doing things. they'll be the primary attractors of the 2nd-ray energy cOming from the universe; however because it'll be highly desirable for them to have men around, those men will likely end up becoming copies of my future-self's genetics. I'll be pretty much only carbon and hydrogen, and very very attractive (kinda like how I am now, but without all of those organs and stuff which makes a person an emitter).
as for how it'll look on the outer side, I suspect that it'll look quite similar to how earth looks right now -- with trees and rocks and stuff (fully physical), but it'll also be a bit like a game world where we'll be able to just instantiate things mentally. because we're going to be so attractive, we'll have lots and lots of little problems and diversity choices that will make up our lives (really difficulty decisions when there are so many options). in fact, the sheer amount of options that we'll have will be (IMO) overwhelming -- and the selection of those options (like trying to choose between millions of awesome things) will end up causing us to make our decisions intuitively and based on feeling.
	because we're going to be so far out, feeling and stuff like that will be so heightened, that it'll be impossible to ignore really, and also because we're so far out, we're going to be something like an ideal instantiation of a number of star's really ideal core ideas -- but in reality. as we go about choosing different options and figuring out those things, we'll actually be sorta like making vibrational bridges between concepts, and allowing those concepts to find their way into physical much easier.
we're basically going to be a backwards 2nd-ray reflector: to understand what that means, let's look at the triad: on one side there will be a lot of vulcans (-5+) both males and females -- where we're all highly attractive to concepts and getting them at ever increasing rates. along with them, there will be a 7th-ray reflectors (-7), exactly like on earth, and these will be the reflectors between the vulcans, and they'll be complementary to the inner side of the dome, which is the highly attractive reflection of the universe, basically exactly like earth (I haven't fully figured out the genetics aspect of this, but I want -5+ and -7 -- both male and female in appearance). remember that conceptual aspect cae easily be at the speeds neecessary to be 2nd-ray -- but instead of emitting it, like a star does, vulcan attracts it. we can think of all of this attraction is then re-emitted as symbol by the vulcans, and this will (rise?) up the dome to collect at the centre-place, which is also the focal point of the paraboliod. inotherwords, the whole dome is an attractor of 2nd-ray energy (as individual concepts), which then, our inter-actions (symbolic output) will then be retransmitted -- sorta like a "foil" -- where we attract something at one frequency and output another (ie, input high entropy (low frequency), and output low entropy (high frequency, ideal interactions)).
so then we become vulcan and aphrodite (way out there), the only one left in the traid is mars -- and other emitters. they'll be located on earth, opposite to us. now, the reason why it's backwards is because usually the ground and the reflector stay stationary together and it's the emitter that goes off -- but that's impossible to happen, because the earth is so dense -- so then in this case it's the ground and the reflector that go off, and the emitter stays stationary. the distance effect is nearly the same, but the vibrational difference is way different: we're going to get much higher frequency, and they'll stay right where they're at, and earth will continue on being the same way it is now. they no longer have to worry about us, and they can all just be emitters all over the solar system and galaxy all they want, and never have to worry about us bothering them.
this setup is also pretty win-win, as well, because any time they find anyone starting to become attractive, no problem, just send them off, and after some time on the reflection, they'll make it into our world pretty quickly. also, it's pretty dope, because the paraboloid shape looks even more like a mushroom than the flat-earth-idea did :)
