### 2024-03-30 14:26 - who can come with me?

I don't have any restrictions on who can come, and I even imagine that there will be some "stowaways". the thing is, it'll start to become so high energy (especially after leaving the solar system), that manifestation of thoughts and emotions will become essentially instant. to get around this rapidly increasing attraction (cause there won't be a sun or any 2nd-ray establishing the system), I have a number of different things that I want to do (of which I'm already a living prototype of many). thoughts will take on a whole new form; instead of thinking thoughts like we do now, thoughts will all become a translation of emotion into symbol. in fact, all symbolic things (words, actions, etc) will come never as a primary output, but *only* as a reflectoin or as a result of something else. symbol is necessary, but it's not going to drive any portion of our relational system. anyone who is in any way primary symbolic will find it very very very difficult to be on this galaxy.
	good examples of this are a lot of my conversations with greg and jaron about things that "mean" something, or are interpretted symbolically to be a certain way. there will be no laws or code of conduct, and definitely no cOntrol system to enforce it. all things are possible, and so anything that anyone thinks or feels will become reality basically instantly. to describe what it would be like, imagine a person that can *only* see what they want to see, hear what they want to hear, and do anything that they want to do -- and it'll be something like that. appearance will no longer matter (cause everyone sees what they want to see), and symbolic word presentation (order, inflection, and stuff like that) also will no longer make a difference either.
also, it's of note to say that some might consider going with us, to have a sort of tragic and amazing death experience. they'll find it probably pretty unlikely that they'll be able to become only-attraction (in their present form), but maybe they like the idea of it, and want to give it another shot in a new body. there are a lot of possiblities, but the essence of it all, is that the speeds we'll go at, everyone will have to come to terms (faster and faster) with their wildest desires and fears, at an increasing rate.
	personally, and although I know this sort of system is what I want, I don't at all see myself ready for it. I still have a lot of difficulties that I still have with my environment. sure a new environment with good conditions will solve the problem, *and* I'm also confident too that I'll be able to create solutions to all my difficulties in time, before my own attraction destroys me too, so I don't really consider it a drawback at all. inotherwords, because my desire is to be only-attraction and I have a willingness to change, improve, and become that, I'm confident that my desire is enough to ensure success. others though, who are less inclined to want to change, will surely destroy theirselves. I'm getting ahead of myself here, but when looking at this galaxy from the perspective that earth is the slowest and source is way way way out there at the fastest speed, we're going to be physical beings that are making a very fast (cause it's attracted) trip toward "certain death", or becoming non-physical source. it's a journey that ensures that death is the final outcome, and nobody will survive it (unless we can find a way to keep up with the ever increasing speeds, which I think is possible).
in order to make this whole ever-increasing speeds thing possible, I want to design new technology that will work in such a high energy environment, and can ensure and describe to everyone out with us, their distance from certain destruction (sorta like a health/resonance bar (with their source)). nobody is "perfect" and I don't expect them to be either, just constantly improving (like source)

### what will it be like?
