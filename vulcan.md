### 2024-05-25 02:16 - vulcan as a concept

one of the things that has often been quite a curious thing for me to figure out is the concept of vulcan. on the astronomy side of this puzzle, there is a planet/moon that's named ganymede which is a moon of jupiter -- and he's kinda weird because living there would be like a fully underwater experience (sorta like little mermaid and neptune) -- but then there's also another planet/moon which was *seen* by the astronomer who discovered neptune using the perturbations of uranus as a guide -- and same thing, he figured that planet/moon must be be between mercury and the sun.
	I actually think the sun does have another moon further in than mercury, and I think it's made up almost entirely of hydrogen and would be highly receptive -- which means it's going to be essentially invisible or black (or kinda both). it would only emit in x-rays (kinda like sirius b), and would break a lot of theories of physics and stuff (thankfully einstein removed the need for a hydrogen ether and also the need for a planet vulcan with his theory of relativity -- so we don't need to worry about either of those breaking any of the "laws" of physics). there are also interesting ideas about what a planet like vulcan means for the solar spheres that radiate outward from the sun.
that planet/moon probably does exist (I think it does), and would be a highly receptive planet -- which means that you can only really see it, if you're attracting (ie, on the same wavelength of) that sort of thing, in order to see it
	to understand what I mean, consider a point source of light which *emits* light at a certain wavelength -- let's say red -- and so anyone with a detector which is sensitive to red wavelengths of light will be able to see that light, because it's emitting. however, consider the opposite form of light now: a light that is *attracting* red light, which means that only if someone shines red light on it, is it visible -- otherwise it's invisible. so the planet is most likely there, but because there's nobody that's shining a light on it which is it's wavelength (I believe it's mostly in x-rays -- which is in the conceptual spectrum), it's simply not visible. it does however vibrate, and does have a mass -- so if someone with a conceptual system that is capable of perceiving such a planet, looks at it, it'll show up to them *visibly* -- but other people looking at the same thing, will just simply not see it, either because thtey don't see x-ray (ie, which the brain turns into astral), or because they're not emitting that kind of light theirselves in order to see it
	our eyes also emit light out the very centre of their vortexes, at a much higher frequency than visible light -- which is what's "felt" when someone is staring at you. that high frequency comes from the concepts inside of the brain (ie, its 2nd-ray system) and it's literally painting (or putting a conceptual tint on) everything that we see. so, until the scientists have (conceptual) eyes which are able to see it (ie, the ability to see something other than their "laws"), vulcan will remain invisible to them.
I also consider uranus to be a vulcan as well -- but that's another story for another time, as uranus is fairly complicated, and I'm learning a lot of new stuff all of the time.
genetically speaking, vulcan is also a bit of a strange beast to figure out: the way that I've come to understand it goes something like this: a father who is an emitter has a strong symbolic system that surrounds him -- and that's the field in which the egg is fertilized. however, if his energy is really strong (ie his eye-cone is really small), the egg will reject the symbolic fertilization process unless the symbolic system of the mother is capable of receiving that system.
	sorta like how the girls in royal families are grown up and fed a bunch of symbolic stuff which will allow them to beleive and be compatible with a male heir that is something that his father defines him as. if the girls are young enough, then they don't have much difficulty believing it, and can produce someone that fits those symbolic specifications, and a mercury "god-king" is born.
sometimes it even happens that the symbolic system of the father is compatible with the mother's symbolic system, and boy turns out just like his father does (ie, another mercury) -- and when that symbolic system of his father (who is an emitter) breaks down because he's trying to symbolically become all of his father's calculated desires incarnate (which is utterly impossible), the boy has to resort to gay sex instead of the normal kind (because of the way that sexual/creative energy (vibrating hydrogen) attracts realities and symbolic output isn't usually very good at getting what's wanted, because sexual/creative energy is conceptual (ie, attractive), and not emissive (otherwise when someone blows there load, it'd be like huge stream of light)). anyway, those mercury guys often times have to become receptive, which is what I believe the planet vulcan (moon of the sun) is all about (its physical implementation being the moon of ganymede).
however, for the cases where the symbolic system of the father is not compatible with the mother, it seems to create a XX male -- and that XX male will take on -- not the symbolic/mercurial side of things -- but the conceptul side of things (both his mother's and his father's). the same thing happens for girls as well, but in the case of the boy, it seems  that the father's symbolic system isn't stored in the y-chromosome (which I think is like a symbolic antenna to the sun), but is encoded, and stored in the nuts. that symbolic system will manifest itself in the "little head" form of thinking -- and he'll often make those "little head" (rash) kinds of decisions, just like his father does. it's a terrible case for the boy (I'm speaking from my experience), because that symbolic system is going to be in direct conflict with the conceptual system of the mother.
	to understand this conflict, it seems that XX sex cromosomes are arranged in such a way that they make a sort of reflector: imagine an array of tubes with 2 balls vibrating inside of one another. if the balls are perfectly in sync with each other, then it works fine, and if a third ball enters the tube and impacts them, the two balls will have a slight collision and they'll rebound in a similar direction -- however, if the balls are out of sync, and the third ball (let's say traveling positively on the x-axis) hits the first ball (lets say traveling positively on the x-axis) and the second ball is traveling in the opposite direction (let's say negatively on the x-axis), the impact will cause the first ball to accelerate (because the impacting ball must be going faster), causing it to eventually slam into the second ball at a higher speed, causing a secondary reaction (which we'll call the reflection) -- the other cases of movement of different configuration of the balls can be worked out -- but the result is that the 3rd ball causes the first two balls to interact, and that interaction also creates a seconard reaction, or reflection. also consider as well that the third ball is attracted by the first two vibrating balls in the first place, so when those two balls are in sync, they attract a third ball which is also going to have a harmonious hit (like all three cars driving on the same side of the road), but if they're not in sync, then the third ball's impact is going to be pretty not harmonious (kinda like a head-on collision, which causes another a head-on collision). also consider that there isn't just one of these tubes either -- (I don't have a number) the X has many many billions (more?) of these vibrating pairs -- which are the different concepts of both the father and mother.
so just having two X chromosomes, the child will automatically be born as a reflector -- but not really a good reflector -- because the father and mother's conceptual systems are almost certainly not going to be 100% compatible. sure there's a lot in there that is compatible (like almost everyone sees the color green in nearly the same wavelengths), but when it comes to things like optimisation, invention, and economy, the father and mother can have very different concepts (meaning very different vibrations), so the reflection that occurs is going to be very distorted.
that child (who is going to be a pretty distorted reflector) is going to have to figure out how to rearrange their concepts to become compatible, because they're going to be attracting the sum/interference of their parents concepts -- which is going to cause a lot of emotional difficulties (for me personally this lead to serious depression and eventually a brain haemorrhage -- prolly because little head and big head had disagreements), which again -- will cause the men to revert to gay sex: from there, he'll either focus and build up a strong symbolic system (similar to his little head), which will make him a mars -- and that symbolic system (it's like a powerful aura around the guy) will protect him from his own reflection, because people have to be compatible with his symbolic system in order to interact with him (another reflective person will feel emotionally/conceptually really terrible around that mars, and won't find him attractive) -- or he'll want to defocus instead and become receitive -- which I believe the anal ring is what holds perception inside of the pineal, and so (I figure) when he has his first receptive experience, he takes on the symbolic system of the emitter -- which -- now being unfocused (viewing himself from outside-in), he's now inside of a symbolic, and is no longer reflective like he used to be when he was conceptual/emotional.
	I actually think it's one of the things that male vulcans do is to try and continually find male partners who can reinforce a symbolic system which will continue to distract them from the conceptual dissonance that's beginning becoming louder and louder in *every cell of their body* -- because as more of those dissonant impacts occur, it reinforces the dissonant result of the conflict between their parents' conceptual dissonance, and the only way to not attract conceptually unwanted stuff more and more, a symbolic system (installed by their male partners) is used to keep the unwanted stuff away (symbolically, of course).
I haven't figured out the female vulcans quite yet, so that'll be anothter time -- however, I wanted to show that vulcan is an *attractive* being/person/planet, and but has a symbolic output which keeps the unwanted things away and in an outer orbit.
