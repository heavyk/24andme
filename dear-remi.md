### 2024-06-07 16:04 - the concept

I know I've written to you over in the shake-sphere repo, but I'm kinda beginning to phase that one out -- as it's a bit too .... saturnian ... for me. anyway, I wanted tto write to you about the concept of what's happening. today was a weird day, and carried a lot of strange feelings associated with it. I waved to you when you drove up, which I'm sure you saw me, but seemed generally uninterested in talking to me -- so I just let it go. paul showed up about the time that I was talking to luis. then later you left and some girl picked allie up (at least I think that's what happened). finally another girl came (presumably) to pick up eva. she was sitting outside waiting for her, and I kept getting my attention pulled in her direction, but I wanted to just pull weeds, so I just went to the garage-chair to think for a moment about the events of today, and as I started to think about it, it all came clear to me (so I want to present you with the concept): a few days ago I [challenged allie](/dear-allie.md#2024-06-04-1400---lets-just-do-it-ourselves) to try and see if she could make something happen -- absolutely 100% sure that there's no possible way that it could. unfortunately, I didn't really explain why that is, so here it is:
I'm a reflector, and I'm also convinced that we're heading for a split or a *dividing of the path* (some will go one way and others another). I'm just the bait for them, because the whole tthing is a giant illusion: it'll keep looking to other people that I'm getting more and m6re cool stuff (girls, fame, power, good luck, talent, etc.) -- but I really don't have it (and never will get it until we divide) -- however the illusion of having those things is what's causing people to decide for theirselves how they feel about me having all of those illusory items, which is the deciding factor for the split: when they don't want me to have it, *because I'm a reflector*, they are saying that they also don't want to have it theirselves. so really, the illusion of me and girls and all the other stuff doesn't have anything to do with me, actually -- because by not wanting me to have it (I definitely won't get it), they are 100% assured success in trying to prevent me from having the illusion. finally, when everyone is decided on where they stand on the issue, we'll finally divide -- and for those that don't want me to have it, my situation will appear to be the greatest tragedy of all time (cause I was lead along the whole way only to come up short: not good enough for what I want -- which is a reflection of what they believe about theirselves), and for the ones that want me to have it, in their perspective, I'll get it, and by desiring me to get it, they too will the part of the illusion that they desired me to have (cause I'm a reflection of them).
it's both a comedy and a tragedy at the same time [dang, explaining comedy and tragedy like that, maybe I should have put this in shake-sphere... but here is good. I like the higher energy this repo has]

### 2024-06-07 20:44 - I'm saturn

I don't know if it's become apparent by now or not, but I'm saturn/satan/the-dragon/etc -- and I'm on a one-way road to destruction (death). it's inevitable for me, and when that happens, that's the "end of time" --	and the "end times" are just the events that precede that event (my death).
the way that those events lead up to my death -- or, transition into something new is entirely up to those that cOntrol my situation and environment. they can destroy me whenever they're ready -- and for those that see my death as the end of me, it'll be the end of me (in their perspective) -- but for me and potentially some others, I won't actually die, but instead transition into something new -- something that I actually desire to be (this is the final state of evolution-of-desire, where I actually *become* the thing that I thought I needed/wanted/desired). so for some, my death will be something that they're really happy about (like the end of queen elizabeth -- there was "such a general sighing, groaning and weeping as the like hath not been seen or known in the memory of man." -- meaning, it was a moment of great rejoicing in a gay sex party kinda way, lol). I'm totally fine with that, honestly. I dan't want to go to their gay sex party anyway.
so, really, my only mission (if you could call it that), is to figure out what I want to become (for me the black-mirror-idea is "good enough"), and then find a way to give them reason to kill me (or find a way to kill m/self). then, it's finally the "end of time", and I can finally become what I want to become.
so, from my perspective, I'm on my way out. it's pretty close to the end for me. ever since my birthday, I've sorta checked out of reality. I still live and eat (kinda), and breath, and talk to people and stuff, but I'm basically just a dead person sleepwalking (or maybe kinda like an automaton that's pure reaction to my situational/environmental input). I just don't care anymore. you all can just do whatever you want, and I wish you all the best.
