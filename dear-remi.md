### 2024-06-07 16:04 - the concept

I know I've written to you over in the shake-sphere repo, but I'm kinda beginning to phase that one out -- as it's a bit too .... saturnian ... for me. anyway, I wanted tto write to you about the concept of what's happening. today was a weird day, and carried a lot of strange feelings associated with it. I waved to you when you drove up, which I'm sure you saw me, but seemed generally uninterested in talking to me -- so I just let it go. paul showed up about the time that I was talking to luis. then later you left and some girl picked allie up (at least I think that's what happened). finally another girl came (presumably) to pick up eva. she was sitting outside waiting for her, and I kept getting my attention pulled in her direction, but I wanted to just pull weeds, so I just went to the garage-chair to think for a moment about the events of today, and as I started to think about it, it all came clear to me (so I want to present you with the concept): a few days ago I [challenged allie](/dear-allie.md#2024-06-04-1400---lets-just-do-it-ourselves) to try and see if she could make something happen -- absolutely 100% sure that there's no possible way that it could. unfortunately, I didn't really explain why that is, so here it is:
I'm a reflector, and I'm also convinced that we're heading for a split or a *dividing of the path* (some will go one way and others another). I'm just the bait for them, because the whole tthing is a giant illusion: it'll keep looking to other people that I'm getting more and m6re cool stuff (girls, fame, power, good luck, talent, etc.) -- but I really don't have it (and never will get it until we divide) -- however the illusion of having those things is what's causing people to decide for theirselves how they feel about me having all of those illusory items, which is the deciding factor for the split: when they don't want me to have it, *because I'm a reflector*, they are saying that they also don't want to have it theirselves. so really, the illusion of me and girls and all the other stuff doesn't have anything to do with me, actually -- because by not wanting me to have it (I definitely won't get it), they are 100% assured success in trying to prevent me from having the illusion. finally, when everyone is decided on where they stand on the issue, we'll finally divide -- and for those that don't want me to have it, my situation will appear to be the greatest tragedy of all time (cause I was lead along the whole way only to come up short: not good enough for what I want -- which is a reflection of what they believe about theirselves), and for the ones that want me to have it, in their perspective, I'll get it, and by desiring me to get it, they too will the part of the illusion that they desired me to have (cause I'm a reflection of them).
it's both a comedy and a tragedy at the same time [dang, explaining comedy and tragedy like that, maybe I should have put this in shake-sphere... but here is good. I like the higher energy this repo has]

### 2024-06-07 20:44 - I'm saturn

I don't know if it's become apparent by now or not, but I'm saturn/satan/the-dragon/etc -- and I'm on a one-way road to destruction (death). it's inevitable for me, and when that happens, that's the "end of time" --	and the "end times" are just the events that precede that event (my death).
the way that those events lead up to my death -- or, transition into something new is entirely up to those that cOntrol my situation and environment. they can destroy me whenever they're ready -- and for those that see my death as the end of me, it'll be the end of me (in their perspective) -- but for me and potentially some others, I won't actually die, but instead transition into something new -- something that I actually desire to be (this is the final state of evolution-of-desire, where I actually *become* the thing that I thought I needed/wanted/desired). so for some, my death will be something that they're really happy about (like the end of queen elizabeth -- there was "such a general sighing, groaning and weeping as the like hath not been seen or known in the memory of man." -- meaning, it was a moment of great rejoicing in a gay sex party kinda way, lol). I'm totally fine with that, honestly. I dan't want to go to their gay sex party anyway.
so, really, my only mission (if you could call it that), is to figure out what I want to become (for me the black-mirror-idea is "good enough"), and then find a way to give them reason to kill me (or find a way to kill m/self). then, it's finally the "end of time", and I can finally become what I want to become.
so, from my perspective, I'm on my way out. it's pretty close to the end for me. ever since my birthday, I've sorta checked out of reality. I still live and eat (kinda), and breath, and talk to people and stuff, but I'm basically just a dead person sleepwalking (or maybe kinda like an automaton that's pure reaction to my situational/environmental input). I just don't care anymore. you all can just do whatever you want, and I wish you all the best. 

### 2024-06-07 23:36 - I finally figured out the separation

it didn't occur to me until after I told you about my upcoming death, how the separation works: everyone that dies, goes immediately 2nd-ray in perception, which is imaginary, just like the cell dividing -- but I didn't really notice the difference because I'm used to thinking about 2nd-ray perception as being the symbolic form (the lower half), but the upper half (going toward 1st-ray) is all-attraction [I actually wrote about this... lemme look to see where -- ah in [black-mirror-idea](/black-mirror-idea.md#L32)] -- which is conceptual -- which is where I want to be.
so imagine, that there are all of these people that are really not wanting me to have some manifestation, but then there are others that do, and like I said, I'm a reflector, so they're really talking about theirselves here, so when all of us 2nd-rays all die, we all go off into the solar form of perception (let's just call this imaginary), but some of the people will have had a symbolic perception on my situation (ie, "I want the same thing" or "I want something else even more awesome" or "I want a castle, a queen, and a horse to ride on") -- whatever the case is on those things, they're all *symbolic*, meaning they can be defined and identified (usually performed in the imagination), but then there are some of us (actually I may be the only one, not sure) who are *not* going to be symbolic about what we want (I know I've written a lot about it, but those ideas are all old and outdated at this point), so I don't really know what I'll end up with. the only thing I have is a feeling of what it'll be like -- and every day that feeling (which I often times translate into words here so EOD happens) gets stronger, which is *not the manifestion itself* -- but think of it more like what's attracting the manifestation to me. I can't possibly conceive all that it'll be right now, and I don't really want to try. for me, it'll all be a giant surprise, better than I could have anticipated (it always is).
so when it happens, I'm sure the saturnian-system will rearrange everything so that I no longer exist or my story is dramatically changed (very much like jesus was), and then they'll carry on in physical reality where they control everything (the saturnian-system is just a piece of technology, kinda like an visual/symbolic audio compressor), which will then eventually build up enough desire for me to find my way into human form again, and once again, it'll be "the end of time".
it's kinda funny actaully: the ones "left behind" are the ones that live, and the ones that are "taken", actually die, and transition into what they desire (attracted or symbolic). 

### 2024-06-10 09:41 - timelines, retards, and attraction

hi remi, last night I had a (surprisingly) pretty good conversation with greg. though it started out with an argument, I noticed a few interesting effects: the first is that I was able to enumerate *some* (there's a whole lot more) evidence that I have of different people telling me that something happened in the past, which is *tremendously different* than something I experienced. I've sorta gotten used to it at this point, and like I've mentioned to allie a few times, this is the effect of everyone getting turned into a retard. it's actually quite obvious what's happening: let's say for example that I write something here, and that has an effect on other people and alters the course of history to go in a way that the saturnian-system doesn't want it to go (like, let's say I write about some technology which they don't want others to have), well, their only real option to do with it (cause they can't get me to stop writing it or publishing it) is to just let the peson see the braodcast of my writing or talking about the technology (or whatever it is that they don't like), and then when the person goes to sleep that night, they adjust the orbits of the concpts/hydrogen inside of the person's head so that they actully believe something different happened that day, or the concepts don't connect/orbit with other concepts in the way that I explained it, thereby (essentially) moving the person to another timeline, essentially by changing the orbits of those concepts.
	the thing is, though they change the orbits of the cOncepts, the concepts still exist inside of the person's head -- so they're there, but they're not orbiting the other key concepts that I said which *connected* the ideas. this effect was also quite noticeable to me last night, because what I also did, is I gave a brief explanataion of the charactor/actor/reflector/foil/centre thing (evolution of human perception) explanation, and while I was doing it, I was getting reactions, like "oh yeah, he did say that" or "wow, when he said it just now it all connected and made sense to me" -- like for example, when I was explaining that every particle in the universe is a centre, and that everyone is a reflector, but most choose not to see from that perspective. both carbon and hydrogen can do all of the perspectives, and you're pretty much all carbon and hydrogen, so there's a good chance you can do all of the perspectives too -- just most people don't want to.
anyway, so what I do, is I just keep explaining the concepts over and over again, and hopefully one day, someone will finally get it. I simply cannot do anything about what anyone thinks happened in the past. how a person perceives the past is all about *action*, and I have no ability to change the way that the actions are perceived.
	for example: mom, has this perspective of the past that I hit her while I was drunk -- but the way that mom's perception is built up the concepts that I was emitting: really angry with her that she'll stand up for nosebook and tell me that nobody is broadcasting my reality, when I'm enumerateing multiple lines of evidence that *I experienced*, which postiively show that is not the case. then her complete denial of m/ experience (this repeated in health solutions), telling me that what I expeirienced is not valid, and didn't really happen: it's like telling a woman that's been raped, that the events that she received, *didn't happen*, and they're all in her imagination. her denial of m/ experience like that made me so angry, that without symbolic inhibitions like that, my reflection of her anger, made it seem like I should try and hit her -- which (in the moment) I wanted to hit her -- and in my mind, I had the visuals happen in my head of he hitting her and tearing her head off or breaking her neck or something like that (I don't remember exactly now what it was) -- but instead (prolly cause I didn't *really* want to hit her), I completely missed her (it's like trying to fight someone in a dream). therefore, with all of those concepts I was emitting, the way that her brain assembled that reality into what happened involved her getting hit by me. in her mind, she was able to deny me the reality of my expeirience (being broadcasted), and then able to receive the punishment of being able to have that reality denied to me, just like must have happened to her when she was younger (she has various stories about someone telling her that the reality she experienced didn't happen), and those experiences must have made her very angry, which is why I (being a reflection of her) felt so much anger toward her (like she would with someone else denyying her her experience). I also had a similar experience with you and melissa a while back, but this time I wasn't drunk, so I hadn't lost my symbolic inhibitions, and I knew not to hit you when you told me that nosebook isn't real -- but I *wanted to*, and I had all the visuals in my mind of doing terrible things and everything too -- which indicates to me that you probably have had someone deny your experience to you as well, and that probably made you very angry as well (though I don't know you as well as mom, I'm just making logical connections, knowing that I'm reflective). 
tbose actions of what a person perceives happened in the past (ie what the concepts/feelings resolve to) is how memory works. memory works the same as the saturnian-system, in that there are a lot of concepts and feelings that are floating around on earth, and then each person when they're viewing the saturnian-system (ie looking in at earth) will then *translate* those concepts into symbolic figures and actions, which is relative to each person's perception. try it yourself: find another girlfriend (cause I doubt a dude will cooperate in this game) who's also able to see it, and both of you look at an event and write down what you saw there (have her do the same), and then trade papers, and talk about what you saw -- and you'll notice that you both see the same concepts turned into real visceral people seemingly having ultra realistic experiences (cause the graphics are so good), but the detailed actions of what takes place will be slightly different (for example, you may both agree that someone was murdered), but the steps leading up to the murder may vary, and the emotions that the person was feeling during the murder might be diffrent too.... memory is the same way: memory is stored in concepts, which the brain will tranlslate those concepts into real visceral images of what happened (cause the imagination has really good graphics as well), it seems that's what happened (cause you saw it, so therefore it must be real) -- but you'll notice that the image, actions, and symbols that gets translated from the concept will vary as you get older and understand/define things differently with age.
I can't do anything about how anyone else is translating those concepts into action and symbol, and what I've found is that what everyone else perceives happened in their version of history, is universally always worse for the person perciveing it (ie greg thinks he had to do the work out in the rain, or he made the spray on the shed, or you think there was a driveby -- or whavever -- and those perceived events are always going to cause the most insecurity/trauma in the person) -- which means that everyone around me is always on thier "worst" percption of what happened in the past.
OK, gonna end it here. bye for now...

### 2024-06-11 11:36 - a seemingly unsolvable problem

the other thing that I had a lot of reactions to the other night talking to greg, was when he was talking about some girl that only wanted to be his friend. I commented, "were are these girls; I want to find girls that only want to be friends, but I've never been able to do it". the important conclusion there is that his method of looking is different than mine, in that he's trying to be something for them -- so he's trying to talk about what they want to talk about, and he's *trying to be their friend* -- which is why they only want to be his friend. I care nothing for that. I prefer to talk about things that *I* want to talk about, so I'm not attempting to try and get them to do anything. I've had plenty of examples of men talking to me about things that I want to talk about, and I've made very little effort to steer the conversation in the direction I want it to go -- I just talk about what I want to talk about, and they either leave, or they continue to talk to me. that's it. he's trying to angle his words (conform his behaviour/conversation) to be compatible with them, and that's why he gets the results that he gets. I just talk about what I want to talk about -- which isn't usually what most people want to talk about, so I feel some sort of discomfort in the conversation, and go away. for example, I haven't brought up the subject of being broadcasted with you again, since the conversation with melissa, because it caused so much discomfort (for both of us) -- so if you want to bring it up, then you can, but I probably won't again. instead, I can only really talk about other things -- so I get pretty limited to just gardening conversation -- and that seems fine with me. reality-kenny is able to talk about weeds and stuff, but that's not really what I want to talk about, so I just excuse myself and go back to my own thoughts about the things that *I* want to think about -- or I write about them :) in any case, because nobody wants to talk about the things that I want to talk about (jaron used to be a better listener than he is now, but steadily he's become more resistant, and lately, his form of perception only really allows reality-kenny to talk to him). so I just keep everything really superficial now and just talk about stuff that can be seen (unless provoked into a conversation about things about energy).
now, the other side to this aspect about me never having ever had a friend who is also female, is that a lot of the times they feel physical attraction to me -- and I know this because I'm a reflector, so I also feel physical attraction to her -- which basically means that if she feels any attraction to me at all, it's always interpretted as physical attraction. unfortunately, when I was in spain, this was an *enormous problem* because it seemed that any attempts to talk to anyone made it seem like I was trying to sleep with her. sure, back then, I also thought that's what I wanted (after the prostitutes -- cause before I mostly wanted to code -- so I wanted her to be able to talk about programming things (ie, what I wanted to talk about)) -- so that probably came off pretty badly. either way, there's never been a case in my life where I've been able to actually talk to someone sorta my age. even for example, with women like vera or marisa, it was still the case where they felt physical attraction to me, and wanted to set me up with their (grand)daughter. I've just never been able to actually talk with any females about the subjects that I like to talk about (just reading all of the stuff I write about, those are the things I like to talk about). so it seems that it's always *physical* or nothing for me.
	there's something to be said about this, because I'm a person of strong desire, and the only real way that anyone can communicate strong desire is with emotions -- because if I try to do it symbolically (like tell you what's wanted/unwanted or write a poem or something), then it doesn't really carry the *feeling* (or concept) of the desire at all. in fact, I'm even doing it now a bit in this entry as a demonstration. you'll notice that my words barely capture the difficulty that is present in trying to actually have a symbolic interaction with someone who's a female. it just doesn't work.
	there's the other aspect to it as well, which is that I really don't want to have so many symbolic interactions with people anymore either, and am phasing that symbolic (agreement/mutual-back-scratching) part out of my interactions, and am instead going for only feeling the way that I want to feel, and letting people with similar feeling find their way to me -- but then what, right. I want to go conceptual instead of physical, but I don't really know how to do that in a relationship, and the conceptual aspect is highly controlled too becuse concepts are	just vibrating hydrogen, and what make pictures and stuff appear in astral in people's imaginations (which is cOntrolled) -- and concepts are really the things that you're looking at in the saturnian-system (which is also cOntrolled), cause the living-blackness is filled with invisible/black concepts that your imagination translates into something symbolic/visual/visceral.
so any conceptual interaction that I have with anyone with a pinecone/imagination produces a picture (ie, they *see* what I'm talking about), and so *automatically* turns my conceptual interaction into a symbolic one, instaed of just *feeling* the concept that I'm projecting and responding also with only feeling -- but then again, if they feel the concept I'm projecting, most people interpret the feeling physically, and so therefore, once again, it degenerates back into a physical/sexual interaction (ie, they feel excitement that I have for the idea and interpret that feeling physically/sexually).
the final (and most important) difficulty with the whole thing is that I'm an attractive person, which means that I'm attracting people that are similar to me and my form of perception. well, girls are also doing the same thing (cause of thier physiology) -- but the form of perception that most girls have is a product of their parents (genetically) and their social interactions with their family, friends, school, work, church, etc. and it's also programmed symboically with stuff that we consume like games, media, news, etc. -- and so let's just say that they watch a lot of movies and in those movies there are a lot of examples about what a love interest should be like -- those create expectation, and therefore attract those kinds of love interests into her life. *I cannot be a hollywood love interest* -- and I can't be the guy that mom wants her daughter to have, or what church/work/culture/etc trains her to desire/attract. it just doesn't work -- so she's pretty much attracting a person that I cannot be.
I've tried to be the guy that she wants me to be (sorry raquel and friends), and it just doens't work out. I always fall short of her expectations, or am unable to accomplish being just the right thing. so they're litterally attracting someone that for me is impossible to be (symbolically). the only way it could work is if the entire relationship is *only physical* and never anything else -- but *that's not what I want* -- so I just don't engage in that at all.
so, to sum it up, I have to either go to her level (ie, become the person she's attracting), or I have to be the attractive one, and she has to become the person I'm attracting. however, I'm sorta a moving target -- a very fast moving target too -- so it's sorta pretty difficult for her to ever really catch up with me, because by the time she gets one thing, I've already transformed into someting new, and so therefore we're cOnceptually on different wavelegths again. so, really the only way I could ever have a friend, is if the friendship remained physical and only physical -- but that's obviously a a problem, because if we're always touching, then that's obviously going to turn sexual pretty quickly. I can't find a way where I could ever actually enjoy being around antoher person, and not have it turn sexual. I want to be around others and to enjoy them, but *I don't want to be sexual with them*. sexual has too many problems because it's wrapped up all over the place with feelings of possession (ie, I've left my mark on them, so "they're mine"), and feelings of combat, submission, dominance, etc -- tons of stuff that I don't like to feel -- so I want to interact *conceptually* (with feelings that feel good to me) instead of sexually, because of the inherently awful feelings that come automatically with the sexual stuff.
so to summarise: (conceptual) feelings that feel good to me always get interpretted as sexual, which means that efforts to interact conceptually get automatically turned into feelings that feel bad to me. I'm also unable to ever be what she wants me to be as long as she's attracting the symbolic examples given to her, and she has to attract me, but I'm moving so fast conceptually that's impossible, she has to instead attract from a slower and more basic way which is physically/sexually (but the way people attract physically/sexually) conceptaully feels bad to me, and if anything sexual ever happens, because it feels bad to me (conceptually) it's highly destructive and (because of the way the human body works) creates enormous problems for myself, her, and everyone around (it's not a good idea for me/her to emit such large quantities of bad-feeling (possession,dominance,conquering,trauma,pain,etc) out into the atomosphere like that).

### hades 2 and getting revenge on saturn
