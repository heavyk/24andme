# 1up-ideas

it occured to me that I think it'd be really fun to just go to russia and make a social network for starters. getting many2many communication (m2mc) going really quickly and efficiently in a fully distributed code/data network. that'll be the start of what we need for the next project, where we'll need to adjust the communication and function of many n[uo][bd]s in 3d, will be required -- so the best application/implementation I can think of (with real intelligent beings) is a social network. so we could just start with a social network and then I'll work my way toward what I want.
I have many other "one more" or 1up ideas in addition to this one that can easily be seen as "next logical step" (on the way toward what I want). [06:00][I'm aware that all such ideas automatically put me into the "2nd-ray" category -- but if they're crowd-pleasers, then I'm all for it. I find the subject quite interesting and a pretty logical step in the direction of what I want -- so seems pretty good. I'll update soon (or make a new folder)]
