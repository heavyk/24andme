# 1up-ideas

it occured to me that I think it'd be really fun to just go to russia and make a social network for starters. getting many2many communication (m2mc) going really quickly and efficiently in a fully distributed code/data network. that'll be the start of what we need for the next project, where we'll need to adjust the communication and function of many nods in 3d, will be required -- so we could just start with a social network, and then work my way up. I have other "one more" or 1up ideas.
[06:00][I'm aware that all such ideas automatically put me into the "2nd-ray" category -- but if they're crowd-pleasers, then I'm all for it. I find the subject quite interesting and a pretty logical step in the direction of what I want -- so seems pretty good. I'll update soon (or make a new folder)]
