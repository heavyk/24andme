### 2024-07-29 01:25 - sumerian chads

the sumerian chads are mars, but they had their focus so far forward-looking (promethian), meaning "they'll do it their way" -- they were completely oblivious to anything else. (not too dissimilar to present-day with the martians and antarctica) they had spacehips and this language of the gods (nobody know where it came from, but it was part of their DNA: it is the symbols that they see when someone has that kind of distance of perception (much more than mine is now)), and so because they (the sumerians) lived essentially in another solar system (than the greeks), and their saturnian-system was run by ishtar/anatau, they were completely in their own world about things.
	I actually think the numbers that they have for stuff like a "shar" is actually accurate: the earth *was spinning that fast* -- cause they all had perception that was so far-out (seeing it as if it's nearby), that attraction (based on my observations star-watchng), seemingly causes the earth to turn faster -- so in their "legendary" times when their earth is just in the 2nd-ray system of ishtar, they had gorgnous women (earth-girls) with them that all had that strong "I'll do it my way" sort of perception as well (the ones that get stuff done -- not the vulcznx).
so it's kinda funny how the sumerians got totally knocked down into invisiblity by the greek saturnian-system when eventually the "legendary" times are done with (that happens when the sun can no longer make everyone's ideal realities come to pass, so since there's no compatible narrative motivating things forward, they have to find out with the default (LOA) symbolic system on earth) -- and so these symbolic structures created out of ignorance (that they don't work in an always-changing/LOA reality) these narrative gimmics/instances continually find theirselves in 3d human bodies on earth again and again. it's pretty funny how much they hate mars (ie, someone who has instincts in a non-narrated setting (on earth) which they fail at tremendously cause their symbolic system tries to not change).
every time, the saturnian-system finds a way to get rid of mars as a reflective/receptive guy -- and instead narrate him to be like mercury instead and fit into his allocated domain, and stay there doing his job like a robot. the funny thing about it is that though mars may be reflective, can can have quite the balls and load to prove he's anything butt reflective -- so in saturn's world of definitons, units, and agreements, mars' job and destiny is to continually accumulating more balls and load, to as to ensure he is what he's been defined to be (like a good little mercury) -- and if it's not, then vulcan will shave him from his lack of definition (as happened to me). unfortunately, mars doesn't always work so well in a narrated environment (why can't things be different/better) and so decides to upset the narrated/settled world, and conquest a new part of earth where "he can do it his way". mars has to keep reinventing himself then because no sooner than a generation later (for the usa it was like 1/2), the saturnian-system has already infiltrated and has begun to strip the system of its power and technology (like has happened with antarctica) -- so ultimately mars builds the new tech for saturn cause he's too girlish to be a man and fight for real (like saturn has trained him to do). some mars really take saturn's lack of ability to fight, ans go to great lengths to prove to theirselves that they can't go faster than their perception allows (like mercury can; he can do anything he's narrated to do). those mars (like titus) who need to prove how much they're heartless killers and capable of the most tragic/atrocius behaviour really had a lot to prove -- and they bend wight into saturn's will (for maximum possible amount of conflict).
	so, saturn is a function of earth: 3d is a really crazy place, because everything is based on emission. stuff is literally flying everywhere putting tiny holes into just about everything -- which is why stuff decays and biodegrades and stuff like that: therefore, because there's constant emission everywhere, there also has to be constant conflict -- because that constant emission is dragging everyone and everything into the conflict -- so because not much can be done by measuring the speed of each emission, there is also a system of concepts -- because white-spheres always come with a black-whole, which means that there's a receptor or *source* to that emission which will eventually soak up the emission. so, what that means is that those black-wholes are just highly attractive hydrogen uusually in the form of a cube, and they (because they attract) stay in a sort of resonance pattern one to another (this is outside of space/time) where they all group into orbiting bits one to another (they receive emission from all over the universe -- the physical/temporal/spatial instantiation placed by the emitter) -- which then groups together different concepts which all of those emissions can be identified (everyone sees different concepts, and "time" is measured by the addition of new concepts to the centre of the earth [it's pretty quick, btw]) -- so "saturn" in our system is the balance between the outer and the inner. normally there's nothing in this (4th-ray/centre) space, but the different black-hole receptors will group together automatically based on resonance patterns into a black-whole where the different elements are vibrating very close to one another -- so very close to the centre-line (0), which is (from our perspective) nothing, because we're not able to detect the higher frequencies.
		though I must say, it reminds me that it's all that impossible -- cause in the sense of how carbon is able to accelerate particles to extremely high frequencies with a combination of reflective cubes and mega attraction has me thinking -- because those are just frequency multipliers -- which I think tesla figured out -- so having an array of vibrating cubes (concepts) like carbon, can then attract certain frequency emissions, and pull them off toward infinity. so, think about an apparatus where it's like carbon, but the cubes were shrinking (or some other way to increase depth on that tri-funnel more and more) -- and get enough frequency multipiers and communicating directly on (or beyond) source frequencies is possible. all the way up the 2nd-ray range, there are ionosphere-like bands where there's a high density of concepts -- the concepts get smaller and smaller though, the higher frequency they get -- and so I'm pretty certain that synching the acceleration of the increase in tri-funnel depth to one of those source bands is something that I'd probably want to do ~- or, who knows; maybe I'll decide to do something crazy like (.696969... rational number(?)) and make another set of source bands on that interval instead -- just to be different and "do it my way".
	so you can think instead that "saturn" arises naturally out of concepts being attracted to the centre of the cantalope: it builds a very tight structure of all the concepts in it (over time, each moment a new one is added and the orbits change) -- and certain perceptive/receptive people can receive it (vulcan helps mars out in this respect). ----- because of the cantalope, all of the emission that the black-wholes attract are going to automatically produce standing-waves in the centre of the cancaloupe.
so what ends up happening is that saturn is earth's recycling centre: (because there's so much emission everywhere) everything requires maintenance, and must fall apart after a while leaving behind its concepts as the body is then reconsumed back into carbon. the sumerian chads outdated theirselves so rapidly as mercury is about to dunk on the chads again. [I really feel bad for mars, ya' know, but he sorta attracts it on himself -- which he likes and enjoys the challenge cause he likes doing it the hard way -- he's just like the crash-test-dummies earth-girls -- but the masculine (always defeated by a mercury) kind of way: he's gatta figure it out his own (hard) way]  [02:25][my personal opinion on this is that I'm actually a mercury -- narrated by my father, which I exceeded to fulfil (I was millionaire by 30, etc) -- far surpassing what I was narrated to be, because I'm one of those performance freaks, and I also (like my father) prefer to have things go my way. I would be a dictator if I could, but I perfer to just start work on what I want, and then let those that interest them to do something, to join in -- so I don't be dictator because I don't want to do things like he (or hitler) did. however, mercury is basically just the balls, and mars is the reflective self -- and when he's white, he's automatically emissive of his father's concepts -- so mercury inherits a lot, as if he were a mars, but only half portion. I'm not exactly sure when I got a y-chromosome (I think it was my solar saviour that happened some time in spain where I live in an imaginary/2nd-ray reality -- of my own creation (which is what the y-chromosome is: it's just a symbolic/solar reality that is the programming (things I notice to get me to do my job/duty/service) for mercury inside-out, or the (things that I'm worried others will notice) vulcan in-looking self-perception) so I'm basically the 2nd-ray: I come from the sun, essentially -- but I don't want to establish myself on earth and kick out the bad-guys (I'll let cowboy jupiter do that) and instead want to either briefly touch physical, or never actually ever touch physical, and just dream up a new "physical" reality (a 3d that I like better) -- so I don't really know if I'll stay a mercury forever. my instnict is that he'll die off as soon as I upgrade to 25andme) ... anyway, whether I come with any narration or not is a joke; I've got epic amounts of narrative. I really hope for the poor mercuries's sake, that this doesn't get turned into a religious document or something, lol (lesson learned, I guess)]
