hi, I debated yesterday whether I should message you today and tell you happy birthday. I also declined to message tim as well (he was my childhood friend and born 24-36h before you). my reasons for him are roughly the same as my reasons for you: there's just nothing that I can gain by trying to make contact, and it just doesn't feel good. for example with tim, he'd constantly call me "dufus" and other names to ensure that I felt stupid. he also called me titus too (which was a bit weird). the way he felt to me calling me those names was kinda like how paul felt to me when I saw him call allie an idiot -- inotherwords, he's identifying something in himself he doesn't like (idiot) and calling allie that. well tim is/was the same way too, and he'd call me all the things he thought about himself.
	this is actually quite a common trope I noticed with vulcan types, and I've kinda worked out that the reason for this is because vulcans contain a lot more of these sort of "black holes" types of hydrogen orbs inside of the brain (much more than the white spheres), which *attract light* instead of emitting it -- which means that he'd simply see (and is hyper aware of) all of the concepts that he's attracted to -- and one of those happens to be dufuses -- so he'd point those out to me. it's very much the same as paul when he's on the lookout for showoffs and douchebags doing their usual chuleria or "machismo" as you would call it, cause you too I've come to realise also are the same as us as well (a vulcan).
so, I just don't really care to talk to someone like that. however for you, the main reason why I don't really want to contact you, is because you can't really help me. when I went to visit you in barcelona, I'd love it that I could be around you and stuff, but the problems that I'd accumulated in madrid were growing rapidly, and I needed to fix them (I'd been ignoring them for a long time living in berlin and stuff), and so I decided that I'd try and get you involved, cause hopefully you could bail me out of my problems and kinda help me get organised and stuff (like mom would do for me) -- however, that was obviously not going to happen, because you're a lot like me, and I didn't really know at the time that from an attraction perspective, I was actually trying to lose all of my money as quickly as possible, because I was so much more unhappy with it.
well, nowadays, I'm in a similar sort of situation where I have a whole lot of problems around me that I've simply been ignoring -- such as greg and jaron and all of the issues related to my present situation. I just kinda avoid them at this point, hoping that the problem will go away by itself -- but obviously it won't. so, I'm not really all that interested in dragging you into my problems again, and trying to see if you can fix them for me. I did that once, and I don't plan to do that ever again; it's just not worth it to me. there's also not really anything you can offer -- cause it's just not your personality type -- like for example, if I were to want to try and clean up all of these documents and/or get them published, then I'd need someone that's *symbolic* and motivated -- and you're not really like that. we could hang out and smoke weed and stuff, but that's probably it -- but that'll obviously lead to sex, and I'm neither all that motivated to smoke (though I may buy another can or two and do a 2-3 day exploratory/discovery thing again if I get the money, but it's really low priority) and I *definitely don't want to have sex*.
	why? because it's not the direction that I want to go. when I was with you, I always had a strong sense that I should use artificial stimulants to try and make up for emotional deficiency. do you remember when we came to madrid and I didn't really want to smoke, and you were in a terrible terrible mood? well, behind the scenes there, dani was like, "dude she needs to smoke; she's not a robot like you" and he came over with some weed for you, and sure enough you chilled out a lot -- so I just decided that we'll just be doing smoking so that your mood doesn't tank so much. that's only one example of quite a few, but it has a really strong effect on me as well, because I feel very strongly that I need drugs (or sex) to make me feel better, and it never did. I'm really an addictive person, but when I was with you, I was on the next level -- like, the feeling that you have where you feel you need to use conditions to feel better, strongly influences me in such a strong way, that I become that way too (I mean, I'm kinda that way too, so we amplify that in each other). I don't really want to go back to feeling that way again. that's not who I am anymore.
the other reason why I don't really want to contact you is because I've done a lot of figuring out of things, and I'd kinda want to know if I'm *right* about those things, so I'd probably ask you about nosebook, and who was the weird guy that you were sleeping with inbetween times when I would see you after we separated (cause you were unrecognisable to me when we'd first meet (having his feeling now instead of mine) and also I would feel him and start to behave like him too) and all sorts of other strange things too...
like for example, I used to think that you were a solar girl, but I'm pretty sure that you're not, and the reason why you felt that way to me is because of your previous boyfriend (not ruben) who feels very strongly to me like an osiris (+-6-+) type, and it was him that made you feel like the sun (fortunately exploring this was what helped me to figure out how the aryans went from being completely black, to having white skin, so it wasn't all bad). so, if you're actually more like a vulcan than a solar girl, then my exporation into that gives me the sense that your mom was doing it in the butt with a saturnian guy and she got pregnant, so she roped your dad into a relationship and getting married, pretending that your dad was the one that got her pregnant -- which I don't know for sure, but then if you're vulcan and your dad feels like a mars to me (similar to how I was before the brain haemorrhage), then you were to him like jessica (my sister) was to me: I was strongly attracted to jessica (also a vulcan), and I thought that I really wanted to find a girl like jessica -- but of course evolution-of-desire is how my life works, so I ended up having to *become* the thing that I thought I wanted,-- and the brain haemorrhage happened, and I got the vulcan girl installed in my RH during that experience (yay).
anyway, it'd be interesting to find out who your real father is, so that I can know what kind thing happens to the other outside-in person of a female vulcan when I had sex with you -- because for me it was quite an intense experience, and it had a dramatic effect on the sun (prolly cause of the oririan bf) and it also seemed like I was strongly amplifying a lot of concepts -- which if you inheritied them from him through the X, then my guess is that it pumped him up pretty good. I'd actually be interested to know if it caused his destruction, and/or if he noticed a dramatic turnaround in his personality as I made a transition from being emissive (like the sun) to becoming more receptive. all those questions and more, I'd want to ask you and try to figure out -- but I really don't feel like that's a good idea to try and figure out if I'h *right* (tree of the knowledge of good and evil) or if I want to just carry on finding ways to feel good about stuff (tree of life) -- or inotherwords, do I want to *be right* -- or do I want to *feel good*? (obviously the latter). OK, I'm out for now. maybe I'll write you again, but probably not cause you feel really weird... anyway, peace out.
