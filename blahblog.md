### 2024-03-29 14:24 - initial thoughts

I've yet to write the README file for this repo, but I wanted to brainstorm and put some ideas out there first.
the name of the repo is a bit of wordplay, because I turn 24 about this time or yesterday. normally I feel both kenny's and my birthday's pretty strongly, and for example last year, I felt kenny's (it's weird talking about myself in 3rd person, just I want to make a distinction between "me" and "kenny") 40'th birthday at around 05-21, which is about a week earlier. I didn't really feel anything for my birthday, and would have just assumed it was just the equinox or something. this year I paid much more attention and not only did I feel the equinox about a week earlier (~03-14,15,16,17), so did I feel my birthday about a week earlier (yesterday and the day previous). therefore, I consider that I'm about 24 at this point.
	what I think happened actually was during the time when I was star-watching so hard, it put a lot of energy into the planet, and I felt quite strongly that the planet was rotating faster. I was inspired to write out in an old repo how the sun's intensity causes the planet to rotate (I wrote that it has to do with the sun's rays inducing a magnetic field ahead, and so therefore "pulls" the earth toward that point where the sun is "rising" on the earth). around that time, I was also paying quite a lot of attention to earth's magnetic field, and since I think they're linked, a stronger magnetic field will cause faster rotation. well, there's a US govt site that tracks the length of the day and the rotation speed of the earth and they said, nope only ms of difference have occured in the last few years (busisness-as-usual-boys at work there, I'm sure), so I dopped it. thankfully, also a day is no longer tied to the rotation of the earth (3600s * 24h), and so we don't need to worry about that. so, I figure that everything (including the equinox and solstice) is running about a week ahead of time. this also happened during the time of shakespere, and I'm fairly certain is caused by both increased solar activity and also the earth's magnetic field increasing (which *should* be directly proportional to the amount of emotion humans are experiencing at the time). 
so, since I basically turned 24 yesterday or so, and this is about "me"/m5, and not about kenny, I figured I'd put my ideas out here about it. in addition to that, it's got the similar name to "23andme" -- which is sorta problematic, which is why I hesitated on calling it this.
	the story behind it is that some days/weeks ago I had the idea to write down all of the things that I wanted to do genetically, and get my thoughts organised. I have them all clear at this point (I *actually* know "what-I-want") and I'll use this reop to talk about them, and then upon doing that, I would use the organised result of that to formulate an email that I would eventually send to anne. the day before I started the 23andme repo, I was looking on wikipedia about it, and I can't remember all of the events now, but there are 3 of them: one did youtube, one genetics, and one open-source licenses. the youtube idea of making a music player has long since passed (I don't care anymore), and I'm a pretty strong proponent of open-source licenses, and have a few critical commentaries and suggestions for improvements (mostly around naming and ease of understanding -- like wtf is CC0-S? mean? I choose "Unlicense" because I can already tell without having to dig through a bunch of words to know what it does), but that's another topic entirely. anyway, I was stoned at the time, and as I started to write, it quickly became aparent to me, that such a tactic would not work. I can't try and fit myself into an organisational structure that is almost entirely opposite to what I want to do. it would require a complete restructuring of everything, and I recognisned the feeling of that effort as being similar to my experience of trying to do the same thing for tuenti. that problem, I called "investor intertia"
	so, my plan was then to simply email anne and be like, "*this* is what I want to make. can you help me to get the tools to work on it?" however the problem is that those tools simply don't exist,-- or if they do, it's a secret somewhere, and the other problem is that obviously I want to make myself entirely open-source too, which I feel some resistance to (not sure if it's from her or from somewhere else), which means that inevitably there will be confliict and difficulty for the duration of the project.
		my experience is that it's very very difficult to work against the saturnian-system -- so if there's resistance and I can feel it, then that means that there's something resistant in me in which they'll be able to manipulate and stuff to sabotage the effort. the typical masculine thing to do is to just push through it and try to overpower their resistance by force (the 2nd-ray way of doing things), but I've really stopped trying to do that anymore. I don't need to push against them, and if there's resistance, then there's basically nothing I can do about it. I'm not going to fight them, and I just don't care. I can wait. these ideas aren't going anywhere -- and the worst thing that could happen is that someone actually creates them, and hands me the final product (ie, only-attraction).
	so, I see no real reason to even try and do something that will be constantly be resisted. when the saturnian-system is ready for me to produce the genetics that I want to do, the resistance will lift, and all things will come to me, just like they did for me finding essembly and stuff (like how it usually is for me). the only thing this repo is really, is just another step in organising my ideas and projecting my next moves (like the illuminati), so that they can come into being because by fear or desire (again, like the illuminati).
the other reason (besides my age) of why I choose this name is because one of the initial first steps to doing this will be to add another x-chromosome pair. I don't know if reflectors gain an extra pair, because I strongly felt that I gained a y-chromosome sometime when I was in spain (I was probably XX before that), so I don't know if this is already a thing, but the point of the 2nd pair will be an interim step: each pair is already a self-canceling emitter/receiver (it reminds me a lot of carbon), and so the point is that over time the two sides become balances, arriving to a "happy medium" between both extremes (coming from the parents). however, with two pairs, I would want to offset their signals again, so that there is an effect that I don't know how to describe.
	in my brain, when I first saw the MRI pictures, I realised what has been going on; it's twisted because it allows for one hemisphere to be partially on the opposite side of my body, and enables movement. well, if I didn't have eyes that want to stay in their sockets and skull stuff in the way, my brain would naturally want to continue to turn anti-clockwise like it's been doing, such that half of each hemisphere is on each side of my body. I don't know how to describe the effect, but it's an extra degree of movement that one can allow for in thought. it enables me to do both things on both sides, and also thoughts can travel forwards. normally, the only thoughts that travel forwards/backwards are the ones that are coming/going to the eyes -- and the forehead is also really important because that receives a lot of these, and that's how we move around in tim5. it's the *will* of the mind, and it's what moves us. well, having both hemispheres turned like that would completely change things.
	that effect would be something like signals turned 90(degrees), but what I want to make, is not 24, but 25, which is another effect entirely different: instead of these signals being turned 90(degrees), now they're going to be thirds, so it'll be someting more similar to how three-phase AC electricity works. the idea being there is that not will all of these 3 pairs be self-canceling, but the triad of pairs will also be self-balancing as well. I consider one pair to be like physical, and the other conceptual, and finally the one I got after my brain haemorrhage: desire. frequentially, they're all compatible with each other, as physical is opposite to desire, and conceptual is backwards from desire (this concept is fairly difficult to explain, which I intend to do better at soon as I start the organisation of the idea).
	having a triad of pairs like that enables is a completely stable, and very high frequency signal, which will be directly tied to the earth. there will be two models: ones without a pinecone (plants), and ones with a pinecone (insects). both the insects and the plants are a direct reflection of what already exists on earth: both plants (namely weeds) and insects reflect the conceptual/hydrogen energy that is present around the planet. insects bodies are a resonant chamber which converts the feelings and emotions (cOnceptual energy) into a type of perception which turns into action, and performs mantenance and implementation of other desires (most notably of the plants) for the planet. most notable of this effect of insects' bodies turning concept into perception is the scarab beetle which the egyptians venerated, because astral images can be seen inside of the shell (probably because it's of similar 2nd-ray dimensions as the great pyramid).
in addition to the strong resistance that I already feel to making this concept a reality, the other major problem is that I just don't want to put anne through all of the difficulties that will inevitably happen. I feel her as pretty venus-like, which means she's got a lot of beliefs, and when/if I were to be around her, then I'll become a reflection of her beliefs; which I don't really want to do. everything that she thinks about men, programmers, etc. I'll become, and once the initial good-feeling starts to pass and we have to get to work, I'll prove everything she believes as right. I don't want to do that to her, cause it's not really fair to her. I come barging into her life asking her for help to create stuff, then turn her world upside down, and poop on it. I've seen my interactions with these venus-types enough times to know that I just don't want to do it.
	in addition to that major flaw, *I* have a serious problem when it comes to working with women. it's never happened, and the times that it came close, it was a terrible failure. even when I would work in starbucks, if there was an attractive girl there, I often times found it *extremely* difficult to work, and had to just put my head down and ignore her, else nothing would get done.
		which, btw usually has the opposite effect: if I try to focus on what I'm doing, and there's attraction, cause she's a (probably a XX) reflector, not only is it really hard for me to think about what I'm working on, she knows it (cause our minds get kinda linked), and she starts to use it to try and get more attention. my sensitivity making working around anyone that's a XX reflector, to be really really impossible, and for the venus-ones, I can work around them (kinda, depending on how much she's thinking about me), but as soon as we get to know each other, very immediately our conflict of opinion about how reality works starts to make a lot of problems (I just let the ideas come to me, and she works hard to figure it out), so what ends up happening is that I (being a reflection of her) stop letting ideas come to me, and start doing a bunch of busywork and trying really hard. in both cases, the solution is always for me to put the work away, and engage with her in some way. if I don't, it's like a nagging sensation that I'm ignoring her or something.
	the other major difficulty is my own belief in this idea. I've never actually worked with a woman before on anything, and any efforts that I have, have been largely been shut down. I don't know if it's because I'm difficult to work with (I'm basically like a dictator), or if that's the saturnian-system at work, ensuring that never happens or whatever -- but my own belief (cause I just can't see it ever happening), is that working with women is basically impossible. they're distracting, and I'm just not productive.
		the exception to that is actually kinda obvious: there have been various times in my life where I've wanted to build things for women, and when they were around (like aditivos-e with raquel or en the co-working place with patricia), nothing gets done, but if there's distance between us, and they're not in the same room as me (so I don't feel them physically), then things work out nicely (like set-game). I've always had much higher productivity when I'm not in the same room as other females.
	I don't really know what the problem is, other than I'm sensitive to them, so I'm feeling everything they're thinking and feeling, and also that I become a reflecton of them, which is never helpful for productivity, cause I can't see/feel the concept I'm creating anymore; I feel them instead (which is what makes me a reflector -- because I feel like the other person does, so I start acting, talking, behaving, believing, etc like they do). they don't have the concept that I want to make (I do), and I don't like losing myself. sure, I can become the object of *your* desire, but *my desire* is to create. I just can't see it working, and it's kinda the same problem as the sex one (another aspect of the genetics that has to be changed) and has a lot to do with my sensitivity. I want to feel neutral to everyone around me (as if we're a part of the same species), not like I'm constantly being pulled in every direction by so many things.
all in all, I just don't see it working out. I've made projects with dudes before, and it can easily work out (if they want it), but the resistance I feel says that probably won't work either. I kinda need to figure it out, and do it myself. I know that sounds impossible, but I don't actually think it is: it's not going to be too long from now when energy has risen to such a hight that my imagination will start to turn into reality at speeds where I can create the physical thing in front of me as fast as an image can be conjured, which will make all of this really a lot easier (and very possible to do myself). that ability, of course has some drawbacks, such that certain people will not want to be around me, because their bad-feeling thoughts will produce unwanted manifestations in reality (stuff like fire and destruction), because I'll have full ability to create and destroy matter with the whim of my mind. as soon as that starts happening, I'll have to be isolated even further, I'm sure -- and it'll definitely be the case that working with someone else will be out of the question -- well, maybe newborns or something (cause they're pretty useless and don't have any beleiefs yet), but definitely nobody old, that's for sure.
the important thing to do, I think is to just start writing down the ideas, and then just wait for the resistance to clear up (cause when that happens, the creative process will go very very fast).

#### 2024-03-29 18:56 - the bigger picture here

when looking at things narratively, there really isn't *any* indication whatsoever that I'll end up working with females in any way -- and on top of it, I don't really believe that I want to become a reflection of them, because what I'll produce is what *they* want, not what I want. I'm completely bound by whomever I'm around, to become like they are. I mentioned [in my rant](../world-net/dear-kyle.md#2024-03-28-1937---the-rant-continues) about how I can perfectly see the problem from hitler's perspective: he gets around all of these guys that want to be superior, and starts to reflect them. he stops being himself anymore, and just has to go along with how they behave and act. it was like that for me in tuenti -- and they didn't like me how I was. I was a serious person with a strong vision of what I wanted to create. they (namely zaryn) wanted me to go out and party with them all the time. I didn't really like it, and preferred to stay at the office and work. I usually work much better at night because my thoughts are clearer then (tesla said the same thing), and that helps me to see what I'm working on much easier. during the day, the sun is up, and so I'm stuck in the astral system where I'm being blown around every which way by those around me, which means that the only real time that I have any of my own willpower is when I'm by myself, and during the night.
	narration is also kind of a funny thing, because according to shakespere (RAJ), I should definitely *not* be engaging with solar girls, or girls that are 14, until they're 18 or so -- and the reason for that is probably fairly obvious: the 2nd-ray installation that runs on my perception (nosebook) would really fall apart, the world would descend into chaos, and likely a new solar regime would be born as a result. or, if I look at MOV, I (portia, living in belmont) will be married off to bassanio, which on all appearances looks to be a 7th ray emitter (mars or mercury). I originally assumed that would be jaron -- though I don't know how much of an emitter he is, and he's *definitely not* 7th ray in perception (3rd ray definitely, more like enki). so it's probably not him, and it's definitely not greg because he's even less 7th ray than jaron (much more promethian +2). so, that only leaves someone else I have yet to discover. one day it occured to me after playing "the witness" that jon seemed to have captured the flat-earth-idea and made a minature version of it and put it into a game. I've always been attracted to him, so then, it's pretty likely that he's the "other witness" [that I've been looking for](../thekla/dear-jon.md#2024-03-06-0422---allow-me-to-go-off-the-deep-end-a-bit). he's definitely 7th ray, and so can easily fit into the mould of bassanio -- now all he needs is to have a friend with some serious financial issues in need of a bailout (it feels like he does, lol -- so I guess I'll just wait for the narration to just pan out on that one).
	the other bit of narration is the one of the "two witnesses", which I definitely fall into the category of by myself. I head this one song a long time ago called "divided by night" by my favourite techno group at the time "crystal method". it was one of those albums that completely changed my life (much like beastie boys, neuorticfish, and gorillaz), and in addition to the song "american way" which helped me to make the decision to give up on the "castle in spain" (like tesla in his autobiography), decided that I would go to the united states instead and "starting over". although I think of myself as being both of the "two witnesses" (one by day and one by night: lyssander and demitrius), there does seem to be another out there. I have no connection to the one that shows up at night, so I can't really say much about that, but from the feel of it, he (lyssander, the one by night) is fairly technical and stuff -- so it'd be more like tesla. however, the problem with that is that I associate my RH with a little girl. it's my LH (kenny) that's the crusty old dude that's trying to keep it all together.
	in the sense that it seems that the saturnian-system was destined to find me and get me stuck in it, I would then have to then map myself to be hitler and the other one I don't know to be tesla. I'm sorta getting ahead of myself here...
so, let's just assume for a moment that the narration is right, and that a bunch of really creative people have accidentally tapped into some echo of the future: it's not going to be females that I'm paired with; it's gonna be dudes -- and by the looks of it, all paths seem to point to some major event which involves a solar regime change. I don't really need to worry about it, and it seems that I have to just wait it out. my "future self" (though I'm not sure about that nowadays), "former white hat" said that I have until 2038, which is basically going to be peak of this 25th solar cycle (remember I'm on my way toward 25andme). whatever happens there, I'm not too worried about because they seem to be having a difficult time holding it together when I do simple things like eat weed or stand in the sun for a bit. their system runs completely on astral, so any large scale astral input (like from the sun or drugs) to my RH seems to cause an upset in their system. I can only imagine that this problem will contiune to get worse to the point that they're even going to have to prevent me from going outside (who's going to pull the weeds?), so it'll be interesting to see how that one plays out. I'm not on drugs anymore, so they can't blame that. I'm fairly certain that there are solutions to their problem though, and my personal favourite one though is the flat-earth-idea.
it is possible for them to use other hydrogen than the one in my brain to build their 2nd-ray system on top of. it's unilely they're using the sun at this point, because that requires megalithic architecture, which is not at all dynamic, and so therefore cannot keep up with today's fast rate of change that everyone has grown to like (meaning, no new technology, not even for the controllers; everything has to be made, and then no new improvements, ever). they could use earth's hydrogen to build the system on, but it's so high frequency, it's just way out of the scope of possiblilities because manifestation would become so quickly. tesla tried to do this with his world system, and he did a number of "experiments" of "bathing the earth in radient energy" and "unkocking the potential in the air" achieving incredible efficiency for power transmission, but that kind of energy, is what I'm convinced started WW1 (after colorado springs), followed by a second set of experiements which sent the world into WW2 (after wardenclyffe).
	when I look at these events abstractly, tesla *did* get what he wanted, because he was trying to get earth into a super ideal 2nd-ray system that would be always at he highest frequency achievable in physical. therefore, what he saw as the future was an extremely ideal version of the future, which needed a lot of existing infrastructure cleared out. that produced hitler as the physical implementation of it (tesla can be thought of as vulcan, hitler as mars, and earth as aphrodite). in the same way, it can be seen the opposite way that hitler produced tesla: as germany lost The war, they moved operations to antarctica, which gave them quite a technical advantage over everyone else. the united states is now where most of the ambitious (infected-ones) are now locatted and in power (thanks to shakespere), so they're looking to find a way to match that technical superiority again, and tesla is the perfect guy to do exactly that. he gets in there does a bunch of experiments and builds a lot of technology which then the USA is able to reverse engineer for the infected-ones to get their system going (the one that cOntrols the weather, powers the little electric CO2 planes, etc)
	now, when looking at these events further out, both tesla and hitler (along with the black prince and some others) are basically just mars+anatau (kinda like me, butt they had pinecones). so when looking at the mechanics of it, both of them "took over the world" -- one with force, and the other with technology, and then they both sabotaged their original timelines and merged them into the one were at now. the only way that they could possibly win out like that would be to subdue the infected-ones and make them powerless -- which then creates all kinds of problems, because they too have desire. so for example, on tesla's timeline the technology he created is really great and stuff, but even still the infected-ones have to work their magic to regain cOntrol over it, and as usual they eventually run the idea into the ground again, because control doesn't work on such a high frequency system; instead chaos happens faster. on the hitler's, the loser always feels the need to "settle the score" and for there to be a comeback -- and in addition to that, some great "paradise" was achieved at such a great cost, is it really worth it to force everyone else into a way to have good conditions?
		this idea of destruction for good conditions can also be felt in the story of the black prince: he went and destroyed quite a bit of stuff across the lands of france, and by taking all of that stuff and destroying so many people's lives, it was possible for him and his men to throw a party. he was also able to use the money tto give his daughters a posh and proper education (at the expense of many other destroyed lives). that really bothered him, and it must have been the cause of his sickness. I think he got over the good vs bad labels (cause he lived in france a while), and realised that he wouldn't want others doing that to him -- so it became harder to steal and destroy like that. same thing with hitler: here's these guys talking about creating a utopia, when all they're really doing is going across europe looting all the art and treasures that they can get their hands on (I guess for bragging rights amongst their criminal friends). both of these examples I think caused a lot of dissonce in both of them, because here they are wanting to fulfill the desires of some, at the expense of many others. desire for one in a forceful situation is not the desires for others. if they're fulfilling desires for one group, they're doing the opposite for the other group, and so it becomes perceptual: what if the black prince was born in france instead of england? the situation would be reversed, and so would be seen as "bad" instead of "good".
		these sorts of dialectices about what exactly is "bad" or "good" when equally the opposite could be perceived, are problems that plague people like us. the *only* solution to the problem is to go off and do things my own way, and let the others continue to define bad and good for those that want to believe their ideology. antarctica was like that at first: we'll go off into a remote part of the world and do things our way -- but after some time, (as things always go with the infected-ones), even antarctica is just another den of thieves now.
	these people that have a continual desire to be superior is sorta an inescapable problem that seems to exist on planet earth. I suppose that it'll continue to be here, and is actually one of the aspects of the 2nd-ray perspectivce, and so long as the earth is a reflection of the universe (which has a lot of 2nd-ray stars in it), that will continue to exist -- forever. it's an unsolvable problem, because it requires that all of the stars change, which isn't gonna happen.
so the only real thing that I can do is to let these guys destroy themselves and their own system. they have a ticking clock for the system which is the sun, because no matter how much technology they've built, after the sun goes BOOM, none of it will work anymore -- and the reason why solar activity is continuing to increase is because of the huge difference between those that want to *attract* and those that want to assert and be top-dawg. we have to separate in order for them to have their system remain functional, because I (and many other reflectors) are causing them extreme difficulty, which the sun is trying to solve by putting out more and more high frequency concepts. in her eye, we can all get along and everyone can get what they want, but that's a really lofty idea and requires a lot of change, which is what she (the sun) is pushing for, which is the increased solar output. there's no way we can live in that kind of ideal environment that she wants us to have.
then, to add to the problem of reflectors causing massive amounts of unwanted for them, it's also a major source of my difficulty too, because I'm one of those reflectors, and my problem is I don't really want to become a reflection of others. therefore, it seems that this is probably the reason why I'm going to have to be stuck with "bassanio", cause he's a lousy reflector (like lead), which means that because there's no way I want to be like him (for example my friend chris), I stay solid in myself, and conform to his image only very slightly. I don't really know, but I don't really see a solution to the whole thing, which is why I was thinking that actually the narrative may be pointing me in the direction of kyle, because he's got a strong belief in a coming solar regime change, and so around him, I'll prove him right. there's even a narrative about it where rocky (earth) balboa (skake-bros) matches up against apollo (the sun) creed (truth, veracity, honour, promise, agreement: mutual-back-scratching), and it's a good fight, but apollo (the sun) wins, but it's all good cause adrian is in love with rocky.

#### 2023-03-30 04:16 - the likely solution...

one of the things that I always wondered about regarding the antarctica thing, and the "gifting fields", is why would they *purposefully* give the USA technology that enables them to travel around inside of the solar system and galaxy. also, after reading the sirian-guide (and all of the obvious power structures that exist within the galaxy) it doesn't make any sense to me why it's even permitted for the infected-ones to be able to even leave the planet, and definitely not the solar system. whatever's out there in the rest of the galaxy, I'm sure there's a whole thing that they're going to have to deal with, because the sirians are way way way faster and smarter than anything these guys got from the gifting fields -- and don't really pose any real threat to the sirians, arturians, pleadians, or whatever other alien races are out there. it's probable that they already have their borders and alarms setup, along with 100% surveilance on us already, so it's not like they actually have a chance of doing any harm, cause symbolically speaking, if the cross a border or a line somewhere, whatever they're attempting will just get disabled or shut down. so, I guess that would mean that the upper power structures definitely have a way of containing this whole thing. but then, what sort of opportunities does that open up for humankind, if they're letting human elites begin to explore the galaxy? I don't really know, and it's often puzzled me (basically ever since I saw the sepehr videos on it and heard marty's thoughts on it, along with my looking into it). it's a suject that's far beyond the scope of my interest (I don't want to get more involved with security, access levels and stuff like that,-- but instead see myself as a free-person that just lives without any cares anymore). I just attract what I want, so concerns aren't a thing anymore.
anyway, it occurred to me that tonight after the previous entry that likely, the reason why the original creators of antarctica setup and the whole saturnian-system, are willing to just walk away from it, is because they're not going to be in this galaxy anymore. although I have no tangible memory of building the thing, I sure seem to intuitively know a lot akout it, which has caused a lot of speculation on my part, what on earth my role here is, because on one side of things, for the tesla character (who on this timeline was likely a "robot" -- a controlled being sorta like obama), I understand him quite deeply, and understand his perspective on things. I think he accomplished (in this timeline) only a tiny fraction of what he accomplished on another timeline (this one is the sabotaged one), and even in a lot of ways, I feel the same thing about myself, though I thing the saturnian guys sabotaged it for me. I find myself to be extremely similar to tesla in thought, and I've always felt quite a similarity to him (also I have a shockly good intutition about frequency, resonance, and attracton, which is definitely not normal -- few people understand that stuff). in additon to my resonance with tesla, I also have quite a lot of similarity to hitler as well. from the outside looking at me, it would seem that I'm nothing like hitler, but I can understand him quite clearly. we share a lot of the same qualities, like invincibility (he didn't commit suicide; that was end of war PR) and becoming the reflection of those around me. in additon, when I read the wiki on hitler's lovers, there's also a strange number of similariites between us. one girl hitler claimed was really into him, but then she said that she never felt the same thing. I can guarantee you that she's going to be an XX reflector, because around nearly every one of them (cept maybe the grosses prostitutes), I feel pretty strong attraction to them. it's been that way all of my life -- and even considering the a-list girls that I invited to join in, I'm pretty certain that they're all XX as well (even the ones in sepher's videos), because I found out that no matter where they are in time or space, when I focus on them, they reflect back to me my own emotion, and it feels pretty good. just like hitler with that one girl, I too thought they were all strongly attracted to me, when in fact, I was likely only feeling my own attraction to myself being reflected back to me. there are other major differences though between hitler and myself though, because he's much more mars-like, and I'm clearly more conceptual/vulcan in perception (especially after the brain thing). I was only physical like that before, and never really afterward. the other difference between us, is that he had a pinecone, and so was therefore considerably more influenced by the astral presence of those around him, than I am. (wow, what a rambling thought) the summary of it is, is that I'm very much like both of them at the same time (kinda like an amalgamation), but born into a period of time where I had essentially the destiny of getting my pinecone removed and seemingly ending up where I am now.
	it's my belief that hitler was another guy just like I am, where he's got a strong sense of self-worth and a tremendous ego (which is a rare quality), which naturally makes him a leader, but because he had a pinecone, he perceived life through the 2nd-ray lens that is part of this solar-regime. all of that self-worth and ego makes him feel like he can conquer anything -- and just like me, one thing leads to another, and he would have conquered the world. I too would have conquered the world, had it not have been for the saturnian-system to stop me, and force me to take another look at what I *really* wanted. for hitler, I'm pretty certain that he started to get a bit turned off by the whole thing somewhere around all of the theft was taking place. it's hard to justify creating a utopia when, these guys are running around looting anything of value like a bunch of pirates. he, like me had a role to play as a leader, so he just showed up and did the work (I was kinda like the figurehead of tuenti for the team, so when I returned to work for them the second time, I just had to play like I was really interested in the whole thing, when in reality, the dream had completely evaoporated for me by then. I didn't want to let everyone down and start pointing out all of flaws that I could easily see, so I just kept going with it) -- and hitler had to do the same thing: here's all of these guys that are giving their lives for a sort of dream, which hitler can clearly see, will not happen, because you can't build utopias on theft, hoarding, and greed like that. a utopian society is giving and sharing, with an emphasis on creativity, not stingy wanting to surpress -- but to point that out would be like shattering some naive kid's dream, so he just kept up the rhetoric, knowing that it'll come to and end, and planned an escape.
well, just as hitler started to become disillusioned with the dream near to the end of WW2, and planned an escape, I think the same thing happened while in antarctica: it's just impossible to get these guys to change; they insist on running everything into the ground: an artist creates a really awesome painting, and someone wants to come and loot it. take any great technology that could possibly enhance the human experience, and they want to use it for control, and keep it away from anyone with intentions to improve the conditons of their subjects. I understand the dillema quite considerably, and it was a source of a lot of my depression,-- because here I am offering to make them (and making them) tons and tons of cash, and they don't want it. they want only to party, show off to their friends, and control things. I even tried to live their life, and it really wasn't my thing. I just can't get into it -- but the problem, is much much much greater than just any single group of people on earth (infected-ones or not), because the problem comes from *the stars*. the only way to find a way out of this system of greed and superiority, is to go someplace where there aren't any stars -- or if there are, they're of a different quality. so, I think they made another exit plan: one to get out of the galaxy.
I'm probably the final extension of that plan. I'm the guy that they send in to ensure that an exit is necessary. the book of revelation calls these guys the "two witnesses" and a sort of anti-christ (hi!) who made earth so unbearable to live in, all the way up till when they were killed (sorta like the ending of queen elizabeth's reign); and then after that a "christ" appears (definitely not me). there are also all of these other narrative things that indicate that there is going to be a sort of dividing (like when a cell divides), and when that happens, two parts that are very similar start to gain a different enough form of perception, that one part wants to go a different way than the other, so they must part ways from each other. it's impossible to know for sure what all of these narratives are referring to, but they're all translated in the reference point of where their environment. so, for example, I'm not out to go and cause a lot of problems, to force the separation. I'm also quite fine with sharing any knowledge that I have, and giving allowing whatever it is that anyone wants to pass through me (symbolically or energetically).
however, it is coming to a point where we must separate, or else things will get too bad. call me crazy, but if there is desire from someone for me to hang around a little longer, I'm totally fine with that. the thing is, I would imagine that decision needs to be made sooner than later, because if it's later, things are going to start to get pretty uncomfortable. in additon, a whole lot of people are still "on the fence" about whether they want to go with attraction or not. the only real way to find out is to let energy keep rising, and figure out what it is they believe, by watching it show up in their lives --- so we prolly have a fair bit of time to go until things that dividing line is clear. some people might think they want only-attraction, but getting what you think and believe can be difficult. even myself, I'm pretty sure that I don't want to be in an only-attraction environment quite just yet, as I've still got a lot of things that need to be worked out.
I actaully want to become capable of only-attraction and stuff like that -- but perhaps that's just too lofty of an idea to do at the moment -- and perhaps what we should instead  just be like, "forget all of that attraction stuff for now" -- cause as we head out, we can just rely on good conditions for quite a long time (essentially until we get bored or start fighting or something). then once we're bored and looking for something to do, maybe we can climb our way up the tech tree again, and start to build out the things we want. until then, primitive living is probably pretty OK. who knows what'll happen. decisions like that one and others will need to be made,-- but if I know these guys well enough, they're going to drag their feet, until they're on the verge of catastrophe -- which I'm OK with, as well.

### 2024-04-10 17:40 - changes in energy

man, the last few days are so changing, that it's hard to quantify it all. on the day of the eclipse (4-8), they installed a "fiber installation" which is really weird. last I saw it, it was two plastic tubes (supposing they're going to fill it with something) going from the top of where the wall opens (near [the burial mound](../world-net/dear-kyle.md#2024-04-07-1441---the-indian-burial-mound)) to the bottom of where the wall opens -- which is really weird for a "fiber installation" which just travels along the freeway, and does nothing else. it's clearly not for telecommunications because (from what I saw) it isn't connected to anything on either side. it likely got filled with something (probably like a wire or something) -- also, when I was watching them do it, they made sure the wires were parallel the entire distance for some reason. the effect is that the energy here is both stronger, and calmer. I got something wrong in my note to kyle, cause I thought the line ran in front of the burial mound, taking the energy out to the freeway, but it turns out when I looked just now, that no, it actually *encloses* the energy in. so even though I wrote it the wrong way, somehow my siulation (which works just the same as looking into another point of time) arrived to the situation now where the energy is all closed in.
	the way my simulator works is basically just feeling another timeline at a distance. I construct the setup that I want -- and because both spach and time can be different in a different timeline, I can assume a different setup than my present circumstances (different tools, around different people, other environment, etc), and so when I look into that timeline, I just let it play out -- and then I get the result. it's not a *real* timeline in that I don't physically see it or anything, but it plays out pretty similar to *real* reality. also, it's the same technique that I use to look at different things in time. they aren't necessarily *real* (in the sense that I can see it), but it is a plausible history that arrives to the present (not all histories arrive to the present, and have too much "plausible deniability" to them, that they're not believable). that simulation is just a general system where I can instantiate any idea or concept into time and space and see how it interacts. tesla did this all the time with his motors (space) -- but I do it conceptually/temporally instead because I don't have a visual centre.
		it would be very difficult for tesla to imagine his motor in another time than the one he's used to, because his brain assumes the reality of the present time -- it's kinda one or the other, but not both. likewise, it's very difficult for me to precisely map out the shape or dimensions of something, because the same concept appears in different shapes in different times. when writing about it, I've learned to *deduce* the shape based on the feel that I get. likewise, if I were to gain visual capability, I'd be instantly locked into the time/perception that is for me "present". any perceptions of the future or the past will be rendered through my perception of now; though, for me I feel it like it *is* in that other point of time, but I have to understand that feeling from my current perception. it's kinda similar, but different in that mine is more like a person getting better at speaking a language (my capacity to translate is limited by my ability to speak the language now), whereas visually, a person can only *see* things (past present or future) from their perspective now. (for example, the sky wasn't always seen as blue, but anyone looking into the past the imagination will will automatically fill in the blanks with what we're used to, and *see* a blue sky -- so like when imagining things like the trojan war or something, imagine instead a sky that's more like a luminous maroon or like a UV light that is reddish and teal hue instead of violet -- hard to describe).
		the reason why concepts are rendered visually in the way we konw them is because the brain is tuning into and receiving concepts, and those concepts get rendered by the brain using the most familiar symbolic representation (colour, shape, sound, etc). the brain can only remix symbolic things that it's experienced before, and learn incrementally from slight differences. a concept can be entirely new and completely unintelligible, and so in that case we learn by *feeling* -- "it feels like this, so it must be similar to it" -- and those create feeling relations/associations in the mind, which are later converted into symbol (either in the imagination or in text like I'm doing now). I propose that it's actually *impossible* (unless in a very altered state of consciousness) to be able to perceive something both spatially and temporally differently, at once.
	the simulator can do *anything* really; I just load up the concept in somewhere and at some time, and then I can just watch it behave. there aren't any restrictions to it, because it's all vibrational -- however some things (like math equations or something) are extremely difficult to see, so I just let reality play out and they take me toward the understanding of that symbolic system; it could take weeks or months, but the reason why I can't see the answer now is because I can't recognise what I'm looking at. once I can recognise it, then I can finally see it. IMO, it's much more powerful than the imagination, and it's the main reason why I really don't want to go visual.
anyway, the effect that the new energy has, is that I feel a lot calmer all of the time. I'm no longer getting my energy mixed with so many other people's energy now (it appears that the energy flows mostly east now, and not really west). however, at the same time, it feels like there's a huge collection of bad-feeling energy building up here (though I don't really feel it), and it seems to be intensifying everything. I'm interested to see how the next few weeks/months play out, because things could start to become really unbearable for others. I no longer feel others so strongly anymore, and so here under these conditions, I only feel myself now. it was the strong feeling of others which also kept me unfocused (same as with the weed -- it'd allow me to tune into others easier), so these new conditions are also focusing me in an even stronger way. their goal I believe was to isolate me from others more, so I'm not upsetting their setup. the isolation is really nice for me, actually, cause I'm not pulled in so many ways now. at this point, it feels like it's just me and nosebook now -- nobody else.
the other thing that's been on my mind a lot (especially during the installation of the fiber thing), is that when I was watching veritassium right before going to sleep through the eclipse, there was one video on knot theory which had all of these crazy new geometric shapes in DNA and stuff like that which can now be achieved by using knot theory. the subtext on that video is that knots are like antennas -- and so when making these new shapes, a person can be tuned to different things. during the video (and many times afterward), I had this flash of the future where these guys are going to be building so many new and cool symbolic stuff, figuring out the infinitely many ways of manipulating (symbolic/spatial) conditions to produce the conditions (which is just a feeling) that they want. I find the idea pretty awesome, cause they're going to, instead of being held back from trying to get to the top top of the universe, they'll be able to do it; become the fastest, strongest, most well-fit dudes out there, each one of them competing (with theirselves, obviously) to reach the very top. anything of the size and scale that they want to do will require massive amounts of teamwork, so I think it'll be really interesting. though I find that stuff to be really cool, I don't want anything of it. I'm really happy to be isolated from that world of constant (harmony through) conflict.

### 2024-04-11 21:47 - the guardian-ship

today was my appointment at health solutions. mom wanted to come to ensure that all of the paperwork has her guardianship on it. I really wanted to just do it all myself
	it's like when greg uses my computer and installs windows on it for me -- it changes how I used the computer -- well this is the same sort of thing: up until today, the energy was only my own, and things seemed to be flowing pretty well. the whole health solutions thing was even an accident. I happened to get a vaccination in their parking lot from one of the free vaccination services, and when I came back for my second one, the bus wasn't there, so I asked health solutions if they had one -- and they said they could only give it to me if I was signed up with them -- so I asked how to sign up, filled out the form and got accepted (to shorten the story a bit). so when it's only my own energy, things tend to flow for me. I attract the people who can help me and things go well. today was no longer my own energy again, so it's essentially just a repeat of PCHC where I refused to see the neuraologist, because I didn't like how he felt.
	another example of this was in the airport when we flew to california. when it was me pushing jaron, everything flowed, and they were letting us through and stuff, but as soon as mom or dad started to push jaron, we ran into every single inconvenience. I always have a really easy time in airports, because I've flown a lot, and so when it's my energy, then it goes really easily. mom and dad have far different expectations of the airport though, so they hit every single problem (and mom tells the story every time about how they had such an awful experience with jaron and TSA). there are many examples other than greg playing WoW on my computer for a few hours before I even got a chance to use it (which was a very different experience than my MBP, which I was too good at programming on, so they had the computer "randomly" turn off, and then stop starting alogether -- cept I tried it again after some time, and the computer turned on again just fine, for about 5s -- then it turned off and has been disabled since). these sorts of manipulations I attribute to the saturnian-system, because it's all about controlling conditions. I'm used to things working for me and being easy, so when all of a sudden something that used to flow, no longer does, I pay attention, so I can optimise myself and improve on it. anyway... those are just a few examples of that.
while we were waiting, mom brought up the subject of jaron, and why he's perpetually worried about his indemnity. I explained to her my theory of how jaron, after the car accident, has become a reflection of the guys that sabotaged tuenti -- so, he's like one of those corporate megalomaniacs, trying to control all of the conditions, to get slightly better sales (or whatever their amition is). the thing is, he's confined to a wheelchair though, so their typical way of doing things is to get the image and facade just right to impress others with appearances (these are symbolic definitions). the thing is, he can't really put on a show like that in a wheelchair, and he doesn't have all of the great conditions that those rich guys have, to compensate for how bad they feel. jaron repeatedly wants to try and get different/better conditions to solve his problem or make him feel better. a good therapist, doctor, or lover can provide sufficient motivation to feel better, but when they go away again, the previous conditions return.
	for example, in spain jaron says that everything worked better for him there, which is great and stuff,-- but *he* isn't better; *spain* is better. if he goes anywhere else with less of those necessary conditions, then he's back to how *he* is. surely, there's probably a place better than spain even (hawaii maybe?) -- but then he can only "get better" by upgrading to a place with better conditions. those things require money, and he refuses to do anything that cOuld possibly make him money -- so he's kinda at the whim of whomever is taking care of him -- and if they're not providing good conditions for him, *it's their fault he's not getting better*.
talking and interacting with jaron (along with my own need to pee), has really helped me to get a grasp of how these saturnian guys think -- and it's been a pretty good reiforcement of my desire to not be that way. I like to think of myself as the centre of everything, where I create the conditions around me I want to have (more like they match my perception), and I don't at all feel like I'm constantly a victim to my circumstances. if I get a laptop stolen (or three), then I just keep going. those are just minor setbacks, and so I continue on improving and creating the things I want. I like my perspective, and I wouldn't give up my perception (tenacity) for all of the power and authority (or girls, drugs, etc) -- or anything like that. I'm a successful person, and I have lots of good ideas; I'm not really interested in conditions, when I make the conditions. I can never understand jaron's perspective.
I explained that it's a whole bunch of guys like jaron (though not in wheelchairs, because they have super tech to compensate for their decrepit and barely functioning bodies). the saturnian-system is just a bunch of guys that want to say in front of everyone else, so in order to do it, they have to hold everyone else back.
I also explained that 
she also provided them with an erroneious timeline of my brain haemorrhage. she claimed that I had it on april 1st (april fools day). I told her I remember it as being the 4th of april (cause 4 and 4 -- I like 11 (or any repeating digits), so this is 44 to my eyes: 11 times earth). anyway I looked it up later when we got home, and it's definitely the 4th. it was a tues-thur class in the afternoon, and the 4th is tuesday (martes: mars' day), and the 1st is saturday (saturn's day). after I just got done telling mom about the saturnian-system, it was a but uncanny to see their signature on it, by trying to change the medical records of when exactly the haemorrhage was: april fools to all of you, I guess. I can't do anything about the mapipulation of historic details like this, and have come to terms with the idea that neither am I being presented presently as who I am (so won't the real slim shady please stand up, plese stand up) -- I got lots of actors, you know -- they do me better than I do, and people want to see my jokes delivered well, so it makes sense. I would too; but it's not me.
	it's kinda funny about this because last night I was talking to jaron about the "return of jesus" -- and I said that I find it to be pretty doubtful. when I was a kid, I had a personal relationship with jesus that was something like I "knew" him -- and now, looking back on it, I can easily say that he was a highly *attractive* man, and wasn't out to go and vanquish all of the bad-guys and establish himself as a millenial ruler. that kind of behaviour is what the (holy) roman empire was like (especially in the later periods). it's one thing to keep order and maintain borders (kinda like the etruscans) -- and it's another thing to go on a domineering slaughter, attempting to subdue the world and impose a structure (for a few years or a thousand) -- so I highly doubt it. that whole thing sounds like the church's way of conquest, than a very attractive person's way of conducting things (people just followed him -- no need to conquer or subdue them -- they were already wanting to join him cause he's so attractive).
	I also explained to him my theory about the two earths: one earth contained the church and they were given power and capability (along with genetics) to subdue the earth in the way that they choose (resulting in nearly a thousand years of *dark ages*, which I guess could be called "peace"). in one earth jesus was successful, and people continued to be attracted to him, and in the other earth (the one we're all in) contained everyone that was not attracted to him. it's like a cell splitting and dividing into two. I believe the same kind of division is happening now, and it's all based around attraction -- which means that whatever the other earth's story of me will be severely distorted (happy april fools day!,-- cause you're the fool: everything will be fake and made up, and manipulated and redramatised in unrealistic ways, just like "shakespeare in love"). who knows what kinds of whoppers will be in there. I doubt I'll be painted as a resurrected christ -- so maybe like some kind of tragic genius, that fell victim to psychosis or some other mental "disorder" (btw, all the saturnian-system guys are schizofrenic by definition: hearing sounds/voices and seeing hallucinations/things -- but it's bad if anyone else has it, so it's labeled a "disorder" -- cause if others knew how to use their schizofrenia, it would *disorder* their fraglie setup).
we went in to talk to the doctor: dr-estrella,-- and I'm telling you, the woman that talked to me today *is not* the same woman that I selected when I saw her picture. they're different people, because estrella in the picture was a pretty good reflector -- but the woman today, was a terribly dull reflector; so dull in fact, that I became a reflection of her instead -- which meant that I ended up just having to walk out. she wasn't taking anything I was saying seriously. she was very "you need to conform to our system" sort of type -- and I was telling her that it probably sounds to her like I have an "elevated sense of self worth" -- narsasistic, megalomaniac, egotistical, and all around "don't tell me who I am; I define me, not you" -- sorta guy. people like me are highly successful, and the majority of them know that, so they teach everyone else how to do hard work and conform to a system which is essentially slavery, but they "pay" tbe person with the money they print -- so it's still free work -- just there's an illusion of compensation. it anyone wants to get up to the top, they're told they need to *earn* it be their merit -- when *none* (or very very few) of them are actually earned anything they have (I'm taling about the guys at the way way top -- not the ones who made it to "upper class"). they know that he way to get to the very very top is though having an unshakable ego, and a strong (illusion) of self-worth -- so they teach everyone else that those are mental disders, and that (like dr-estrella suggested to me), that I get "treated" for that, and she strongly encouraged me to enroll in behavioural psychology.
	after talking to mom about it this evening, she's sill holding on to the idea that I should go and talk to the behavioural psycologist, because she claims that they'll be able to tell me the things "you can't see in youself". unless the psycologist is a good reflector of me, I'll become a reflector of them, and all of the stuff that they're "treating me for" will actually be aspects of their own self that they disapprove of. I'll become them, and I'll repeatedly tell them that they're only trying to treat theirself. if I enjoyed the conflict, then I'd go, and "prove" myself to them -- perhaps cycling though various psycologists until I found someone that's actually a reflector -- but it sounds like an enormous waste of time to me. I don't have anything to prove anymore -- so I'm likely just going to refuse to go. I'm making	tons and tons of improvements already, and I really dislike being a reflection of others. if they don't feel good, I don't want to be there; they're not attractive to me; and if they do feel good, then all of the saturnian-system work is in vain (it'll never happen -- they'll keep swapping them out to be the dull reflectors, because that's the beginning of the end for them).
instead of doing all of that, what today helped me to realise is that I'm making enormous improvements, all by myself -- and I'd say that my rate of improvement is accelerating too. if I platau or something, then it's a good idea, but the system itself is designed to keep people away from beliving in theirselves (I need someone else to help me, like a therapist or doctor). the whole thing is massively disempowering -- and I suppose I could try to go through with it, but I just prefer not to, at this point. I'm OK being a reflector, and there's no real point to trying to change them or to become some kind of *gold*. I like that I'm the model bad-guy. I'm a terrible terrible very evil person -- but because I feel so good (not cause of conditions, but because of my perception), all of that awfulness comes out. reborn into another different set of circumstances, where I don't have the opprtunity to learn about LOA, I'm the same as the saturnian guys: I feel I need to manipulate conditions to get what I want. I know them as well as I know myself, and the *only* way for me/us to *ever* be a non-terrible person, is to have the conditions or the perception: which is attraction. we're the same, you know. I reflect all of good and all of evil. I am the universe.

#### 2024-04-11 23:38 - I reflect all-that-is
- direction toward foil
- if they wanted me to be gold, then they'd allow it
	- nobody likes gold kenny, because gold kenny gets everything he wants and all things come easy. they want *silver* kenny instead, having no self-defined attractive qualities
	- I don't really want to be gold (in the symbolic sense) either. gold is emissive, and I want to be *attractive* -- so I'm actually heading more in the direction of black/carbon/foil, because more like how source is: I want to reflect back (and feel myself) only higher frequency versions of their output.
	- becoming a good foil com5s with practise.

### 2024-04-13 14:30 - I have all of the disorders...

I just woke up, and in one of dreams or impressions that I had while sleeping, I was in a situation where remi's daughter (allie) was liking me, and I didn't want to be anything other than just a friend. I explained to her that she needs to write patricia and ask her for her opiion on the subject. I explained that getting physical with me is a terrible idea, and I've seen a lot of really good women turn terrible after being with me. it's not a good idea, and I honestly wish to be friends. I've never had a girl around me that shares similar interests as I do, nobody that I can talk to about my ideas or anything like that (which is cause I write -- because these are subjects that neither men or women will talk with me about, and so if I want to make any progress on the ideas, I *must* talk about them).
	the reason why I flatly refused to go any further with dr-estrella is because I'm not interested in someone telling me that I have a disorder or any problems -- because *I have all of them*. that's right, contained within me is the totality of everything that is both "good" and also "evil". so, if she's looking for things that are wrong about me, I have examples of them all, and so therefore can appear to have all of the stuff she will think I need to be cautious about and stuff like that. that kind of conversation doesn't help me, because I already know I have all of the problems. I'm also not looking to try and get rid of the problems either. those problems are vibrational (ie, mental) and so if I didn't have the capability of chaning my perception, my entire body would be on the verge of death.
		the guys at nosebook's bodies (even the young ones) are all on the verge of death and are deteriorating at a rate that is much more rapid than normal people's bodies deteriorate -- the difference between them and me/others, is that they have conditions which can produce vitatility in their body and partially overcome the vibration that they have going on. without those cOnditions, they'd become decrepit die off really quickly.
	conversations with people like her, who are just trying to identify that I have a problem (which they think they can solve with some kind of action or behavioural change (as in "behavioural psycology")), are going to run into a difficult problem, because *I will tell them I have that problem* -- and I will also tell them how to get around that problem. especially the medical insitution has no clue at all (and I believe this is on purpose) how to help a person actually improve from those "disorders". what I'm interested in, isn't knowing that I have a "disorder" (cause I know that), but learning all that there is to know about how that disorder works in the body, and different perceptive tricks to get around it. IMO, the *only* way to get around those disorders crippling effects (literally, they paralyse half of my body), is by altering m/ *perception*. so, when she says "I'm only wanting to talk to you about the physical aspect of your body and make sure that's healthy" -- she's strongly mistaken and isn't a person I want to talk with because -- IMO perception is the *only* way to improve the phsical aspect. she can prescribe medications or other physical things to try and overcome the vibration, but the source of those physical ailments is the vibration.
	I try and explain to her that *I* am not the source of those vibrations in my body, but they occur because I'm a reflection of all-that-is (good and evil), and so when I focus on someone that doesn't feel good, they get amplified. I know those vibrations don't come from me, so I don't care much to experience them, and usually just relieve myself from the situation. I have no control over the fact that others are using my perception, and so therefore *I* cannot solve those vibrational sources (I'd have to get all of nosebook to change to my perception for that to work -- which isn't going to happen),--- so, I just work with the things that I can do something about, which is how do I feel (igorning who's the cause/source of the problem), and just go with that -- *and that solves the physical problem*. just by me finding a way to feel good about the physical problem, and not needing that physical condition to change so that I can feel good, they seem to be able to find a fix (or something, cause the physical ailment goes away). her method of doing things (focusing on the physical symptom) would have caused me to die from an exploding bladder (like tychos brahe). so, if I want to pee, I have to find a way to *feel* like I can pee, which is the same for m/ physical ailments: if I want to feel better physically, I have to find a way to *feel* like I want to be/feel better. the physical aspect is completely mental for me. she wants to separate it from the psycological aspect, and that's why I had to dismiss myself. repeated efforts to explain this to her, and she couldn't hear me (the entire system can't hear me), so I realised my efforts are in vain. I actually had high expectations for this, because the picture of estrella looked like a chinese woman to me, and they actually understand (to some extent) that the mental body's wellness is direcly for the physical body's wellness.
so, what I'm actually looking for, is an actual *friend* -- someone that I can talk with and expand on some of these ideas, but that's pretty difficult to find. if she she's too young, she has no concept of anything that I'm talking about, and though she could have intuitive insight (like jaron does often), it's not likely she'll be able to logically (or conceptually) be able to give me much insight. it's usually men that are my age and older which have any knowledge of these sorts of things -- but by the time they're my age (40), they all believe that it's *conditions* that are the solution to the problem (just listen to my conversations with dad or greg). men tend to be against any type of conversation related to perception (again notabe here are my conversations with dad), and so I don't really find talking to men to be all that helpful either (I'm mainly lecturing them on how *everything is mental*, not conditional (thoth agrees, btw)) -- so I figured that maybe what I'm looking for is someone who's actually *receptive*, because someone who's just blasting out their mental ideas, isn't going to be making any progress. for *any adjustments to perception, one must be receptive*. there's no other way.
so, for all of my life, I've been chasing this elusive receptive friend who can talk about how the entire world is a reflection of our perception (ie, mental) -- but I can't seem to find them. they either don't exist (highly unlikely), or there's something else at work here preventing them from showing up in my life;--well the soution to that is the same as for the problem: find a way to feel good about none of these receptive friends being around, and just do my own thing.
I also refuse to be physical with someone, until they can understand the mental aspect of the physical experience -- because, in the physical transfer of energy, I essentially turn them into a prostitute. they're essentially having sex with all of the "bad-guys" out there, when they have sex with me. it's embarrassing for them, and disheartening to me to watch them all crash and burn, because I amplify all of their pain/anger/insucrity/etc for them. I have all of that going on in my body *all the time* -- but nobody really notices because I like to feel good enough (and can do it perceptually), that none of those terrible vibrations ever make it up to my physical -- and the ones that do, I'm gaining new forms of perception all the time, so that they're no longer an issue.
	being physical with a bunch of women (or girls, though it would take time to manifest), would produce a whole lot of really awful women that think they need conditons to solve their problems. I don't want to be around those kinds of women (like dr-estrella), and so I want to find a way to teach them to get around those vibrations *unconditionally* (ie, only-attraction) like I do. if I wanted to hang around a bunch of "I need conditions to change so that I can feel good" types of people, I'll look no further than the majority of the venus-types. they have to understand attraction, for anything physical to work.

### 2024-04-15 04:06 - new energy thoughts

since the eclipse, which was also the day they installed the "fiber", energy has been really different. I mentioned previously that I've essentially lost all of my motivation, which remains true, but in addition to that, I'd say that the next most notable difference is that I no longer feel that "oh wow" or feeling of divine revelation that I often times get (especially on drugs), but most commonly I get while I'm writing. obviously those "Ohhhhhh" moments aren't coming from me, because I've usually made the realisation already (which is why I'm writing about it), but I surmise they have to be coming from other people -- most notably those of nosebook. since I no longer feel their reactions in the same way anymore, writing here is quite a different experience.
	speaking specifically, I must say that when I was preparing for writing the [mars and mercury history pontificate](../shake-sphere/history-potificate.md#2024-04-15-0034---the-separation-of-mercury-and-mars), some of the thinking that I did was right after writing the previous entry, while out in the very back yard on the other side of the fiber -- and while I was out there thinking about the mechanics of mercury and mars, and why mercury is also always looking for his receptive friend (ie, mars), I started to think of some examples (which I didn't include) such as david and johnathan, or various shakespere plays, I started to get that "Ohhhhhhh" moment when I was out there (on the other side of the fiber). additionally, I also notice a very tremendous difference between how I feel when I'm outside of the house (like say at walmart or sam's club) vs home: again, I have a stronger sensation that I'm being pushed by someone else's vibrations. I don't like that sensation, and even when I went to health solutions, while talking with dr-estrella, the ammount of force and strong pushing/angry sensation that I felt from her (or whoever is operating her body), was so strong, it's what caused me to leave. I don't want to fight like that, and I'm actually beginnning to really prefer being at home now.
	also, when talking with greg last night, there was another large thing that I noticed as well: greg emits *a lot* of astral energy, which I usually feel pretty strongly, but ever since the fiber installation, not really so much anymore. in previous times when we talked, I reflect his astral emission back to him, and bad-feeling gets amplified really quickly (like it did with dr-estrella). this time it didn't, and I was able to have a an almost entirely peaceful conversation with him. I actually even kinda liked the conversation cause I can't feel him anymore like I used to, and the other thing is, I don't feel like I have to avoid him anymore now either, because again, he doesn't feel bad to me anymore. I really like how all of the astral energy is dampened now.
when away from home, there's so much conflict and confusion that's all over the place, and I really don't like to be subjected to other people's energy, so here is actually where I'm starting to really enjoy being. sure, it's annoying that I don't have any m6tivation here anymore, but that's something that I'm sure I'll end up coming to a solution on just fine.
	one of the things that I was considering is to eat weed again in this new energy, (I really like being sober, so I consider doing it maybe once every few months or so) because weed has a strong effect on astral energy (I feel it stronger) which, if it's completely dampened now, that means that I won't be affecting others when I eat weed -- and also it may give me some ideas on some things to do. I considered it pretty strongly because I looked at the clock before writing this and the one upstairs said 04:11 -- and that made me think, "OK, if I go prepare weed now, I can have it ready for 4:20" -- but I decided that was probably a bad idea and decided to come down to write this instead. wow so yeah, I guess the kitchen clock is about ~7m fast...

### 2024-05-03 07:39 - strange things happened last night

- I keep getting these sorts of flashes where I see images -- they're kind of like memories, or how when a symbolic person (this happened frequenty with vera) would transmit an image to me.
	- a few days ago, when I was thinking about pulling remi's weeds again, the images were of allie, but she was naked, and it came with a strong feeling of desire.
	- then, yesterday when I [wrote to anne](/dear-anne.md), the images started to change again, and there were more this time, but none of them were clear enough that I cOuld actually see what they are.
	- additionally, yesterday I was talking to jaron while making lentils about his experience working on the cruise ship, and was saying that I just don't think that the party atmosphere is something that I want to go back to, because girls emit (strongly for me) a feeling like "you're missing out on (being with) me / what I have" -- and I don't like that feeling at all because I'm not. they don't have what I want. (and, at the ttime I was working on what I wanted to work on). I went outside again to work on the yard, and was thinking about how as a reflective person, all of those girls emitting that feeling got that feeling reflected back to them, and so to them they probably felt as if I was emitting a feeling to them that they're missing out on *me*. oh well, I guess. anyway, that was somehow also combined with what I wrote to anne [about being fully planted](/dear-anne.md#2024-05-02-0540---initial-thoughts), because at the same time there were all sorts of images about how I'll just pass on everything and just wait it out for the separation to occur (paso a paso!)
	- finally during the night, I was thinking about the mars + anatau combo topic I'll soon write more about, but the conclusion to that one is that I don't need to worry about finding anatau/urania (female vulcan) out there because I already have her inside of me. by default, all I have to do is to wait it out (cause they can't hold it away forever), and I'll get anatau back to me. that caused more flashes.
		- the obvious missing implication to this one is that anatau is the RH of my brain, which is what their entire 2nd-ray system is entirely built upon. they obviously don't want me to get back to having access to her (probably for many reasons) -- and I'm also OK not having her, because I've come up with both the flat-earth-idea and the black-mirror-idea as workarounds to the problem, where the 2nd-ray system that they rely upon can be externalised, and I can then become a multi-bodied consciousness (more on that in the future) and experience the full spectrum of desire (every possible frequency on the pen-rose).
		- therefore, I think it finally set in that they want to keep my 2nd-ray installation.
	- after that, I started getting flashes about AYLI, and I also felt strongly that they were going to push me to end up with allie. I was strongly against that idea, and decided that I *must* find a way to remove my nuts. I find them very unsightly, and I don't like the feeling of them. we went back and fourth for a while on that one -- cause seemingly they don't want me to remove my nuts (I'm pretty certain it's how they control my vision), and if I were to lose them, then they'd lose control. so if they can't control the visual system without the nuts (and neither do I want the visual system), then I think laser eye surgery will break all of the eye-fibers and prevent me from seeing images in my eyes. either way, if they're going to put me with her, then the relationship has to be platonic because I do not want to have sex with nuts.
	- they kept pushing on the whole sex thing, and I finally came to the conclusion, that if I'm going to be put with allie, then I'll just make a deal with her: I'll give her whatever she wants (for herself, and not in a negative sense), in exchange for not having sex -- because if we were to have sex, I'd probably lose my capacity to "see" things like I do now, because my concepts (which I use to identify what I "see") will all be jumbled up with her concepts now -- and like with all other past experiences, I have to relearn those concepts now *from her perspective* -- which is really really annoying to be reset over and over like that -- when I think, that if I can get her to think about how many other girls (besides just her want me to create what I want to create), then I hope we can find an agreement.
	- after quite a long time of struggling with the fact that they're pushing me into something that I don't want, I finally had to just take my own advise (to jaron 2da) and just find a way to be like the situation that I'm getting pushed into, and just only be doing things that I want to be doing. I then decided, OK, fine I'm just gonna lean into this, and sure I guess allie and I will just have fun and stuff because I'm not able to control anything.
		- there is a significant subtext here as well, because if they're going to force us to start having sex, then with the nuts still on, there's going to be a lot of symbolic output (getting rid of the nuts is the first way to being only-attraction), and so they're going to have to deal with huge amounts of (not good feeling) sexual energy output. I don't think that'll have any effect other than chaos and a whole lot of unwanted (think AD69 -- but with a conceptually reflective person instead of physically reflective, so less physical destruction, and more mental destruction), and that's just not something I can worry about; if that's how they want to make the separation, then fine I'll just endure until the sun pushes us out.
	- some time after just accepting the fact that there's nothing that I can do, and I'll just have to go along with whatever they throw at me for the next (not sure how long) until they've destroyed theirselves or separated -- the feeling finally subsided and again I'm back to thinking about AYLI. in the production (losal) that I saw, rosalind was played by a girl with dark hair, and celia was played by a girl with orange hair. originally, when I thought of the play, I just figured that celia was the traditional XX (reflective) female just like gertrude, and not at all a solar girl (orange hair). I didn't really know why they casted her that way, but she (don't remember her name) played a good enough of a "dumb blonde" that it was actually kinda fun.
		- [08:43 - paused to look for the production so I could link to it, but seems that the video has been taken down -- not sure why] there's also this weird part in the beginning of the play when they're singing the song ("hey nani nani" are the lyrics that I remember), where the guitarrist essentially says, "he wants to make you all receptive" -- or something like that (my memory is kinda hazy on it) -- and I always wondered what he meant by that -- because here's a guy that seemingly perceives something about the future and they're relating it to the AYLI play, and saying that. the reason why him saying that was interesting to me, is that also the sirians in the sirian-guide talk about how it's now time for humankind to learn its receptive side (so I had a bit of a precondition to believe that it's true, humans are going to begin to learn to receive, at least energetically (which the sirians say could cause a kind of insanity) but the guitar guy made it sound like physically receptive)
	- anyway, then I was thinking now about this other strange set of events that happened around the time of the eclipse. there was a song by "blackmore's night" called "shadow of the moon" -- which I just looked up the lyrics, and they're now nothing like how I rememberod hearing them. anyway, the way that I heard it (originally), it was a song about a girl that was conceived under the shadow of the moon (ie, during the eclipse). anyway, the night before the eclipse, I had a number of these other weird flashes, and the images ranged anywhere from a solar girl (in some of the images, it was kyle's wife laura), conceiving a girl during the eclipse. I also had other flashes during that time, also of the AYLI play, because in it, rosalind (ie, my RH) is said to have been bound to celia since birth -- and in the images, not only was I there for the birth, but also the birthing process invovled a strong orgasm, and not the typical labour assocaited with childbirth. anyway -- from then on, we were essentially together. I didn't really know what the meaning of it was, so I just left it, took a shower and went to sleep.
		- it has happened in the past where I've been in a partial dream-state, and I found myself in the same place as laura (I think it was right before one of the snake-bros gatherings), and it was like I was really there (I think I even wrote about it) -- but obviously I couldn't see anything or anything like that. so I have been summoned before by a solar girl, and likely appeared in astral. additionally, I had a similar experience with rianne, where also I felt like I was summoned, and experienced myself simultaneously in two places -- and crazily enough, two people (eric and jaron) both said that they saw me walking around with rianne, when I'd been at home all day. so, I think it's quite possible that these girls can summon me, if that's their desire. since I slept through the eclipse, I have no idea what could have possibly happened during that time.
	- so let's say that instead of me being rosalind in AYLI (as if I had access to me RH again), then that means that rosalind is externalised and I'm not just looking for celia, but I'm eventually ending up with both rosalind and celia. well that, works out pretty nicely, because the pen-rose has three directions to it, which means that there are going to be three predominant forms of perception that can anyone can go in the direction of. I'll call them X (only-attraction, earth), Y (solar), and Z (female vulcan, rosalind) -- and between three of these different forms of perception, we'll contstantly alternate.
- the conclusion of the night, and the way it was when I went to bed, is that I'll just lean into the allie thing, but we're going to have to make a deal, then I want to start to coordinate with anne, and see if we can't start to produce some of these genetics -- or if for no other reason, I'd just like to talk to her, because I find it very easy to convey these genetics ideas (similar to how I found it easy to convey the cosmic ideas to sarah). so, then for the next period of time, we'll just stay chill and we'll create the version of me that'll work essentially for everyone. also, it seems that allie won't be the only one, as I do feel like it's quite plausible that there is a celia out there somewhere -- and so hopefully, if everything works out, she'll become allie and my daughter. that seems pretty cool.
	- there are a lot of cool aspects to this, because I'm not totally sure what exactly produced allie, (whether it was paul, jaron, or both) which will have properties of the saturnian-system, so she'll represent vulcan in that sense, then the other one (celia) will represent the instantiation of the solar, which is quite a good reflection, I would consider. -- then we'll build the black-mirror ourselves (leaving them pluto), and then off we go. I actually think this plan will work out quite a bit better, actually.
- anyway, after I came to the conclusion last night, the flashes changed, and now they weren't so sexual at all, and no longer was she naked anymore (only sometimes in her underware), and they also transformed to where we were like super inseparable (like always holding on to each other and stuff, spending all the time together).
- so then now, hopefully when I talk to allie (I heard her calling for something last night), we should be able to get it all worked out, and now I'll have an inseparable shadow. I suppose that was kinda the thing that I don't really want (because I'm no longer going to be myself anymore, but a reflection of her), but as we're together, I'll get more and more into her head, such that my concpts will now have to find their way out through her form of perception. in a sense, this is kindof a strange thing, because I'll basically be learning to think like saturn (which is like the common denominator of all the universe), and translate my concepts out through that.
- I want to get everything I have up on the internet and stuff before starting the relationship (so, over the next few days), but hopefully she lets me continue to write and stuff, because as long as we're together, kenny doensn't exist anymore. I'll have to find time (whenever that may be, if ever) to be alone, to ever recover who I am. I'm basically going to be completely gone, but oh well. I don't think they're going to ever let me be alone again anyway. hopefully it all works out.

###	2024-05-04 13:18 - all or none

I just woke up. this morning I had the sense that the girls are going to figure it out without me, which I'm quite happy about -- cause I mean just think about this from their perspective: if there's some big man on top giving out orders and telling them what to do, they're not really doing it. if they figure it out and are able to accomplish it, then all I did was provide the idea (I offer all of my ideas free with the exact intention that they actually get used -- and even if the boys wanted to use the idea, it's open and available to them too -- I don't mind). then, after talking with mom this morning about jaron and his trip out to go see dad, I had these strage reactions afterward, possibly because (well, I don't know, actually) -- my thought on it is, perhaps that if jaron stays around for *my* birthday (doesn't have anything to do with him), then that completely alters the trajectory of things, in a way that I don't really understand.
	the way that I think about this is simple: the people that are around me, I become a reflection of, and so if jaron hated himself well enough, I would care nothing for him, and just let whatever happen happen -- however, I have to assume that jaron actually does care for himself (in the way that I care for him), because that's how I treat him (I learn about people by the way that I treat them). therefore, any way that I treat jaron, and any advise that I give him, *is attracted by him*.
the other thing that stood out to me in my conversation with mom, is that she was asking me why I don't want to fly -- and I told her it isn't really anything to do with flying anymore (because I'm not watching-stars, and am no longer constantly on the verge of kundalini rising -- because of elevation (same reason why I like to sleep on the ground) airplanes are much higher energy, and cause elevated states of mind -- mountains are different), and I told her that I would be willing to fly with jaron to vegas, and then go on to utah -- but I'm not really that interested in going to california.
	there's no real logical reason to do it -- just I teld to follow the narrative that's been given to me (again, not sure why) -- so I know that I'm gonna stay away from 14yos (k-prime if she exists) and solar girls, and also I'll steer clear of california, and a few other things which I can't remember now. they all seem to fit actually just fine: I've found out over the years (especially with my experience with raquel), that the solar girls' (2nd-ray) mindset, just isn't the one that I want to have. I want to be earth, not solar -- and I've been pushing for the nuts removal, because the nuts is notably 2nd-ray in perception (very close to the bottom, if not pure 3rd-ray, actually) and that's just not what I want to be the source of my arrousal. I want to be 1st-ray, 5th-ray, or 7th-ray in perception, not 2nd-ray. I don't understand the california thing, and I can perhaps fully understand the 14yo thing, because that brings a strong sense of nepotism to it -- which I'm definitely not a fan of. 
	oh yeah, another one is that there will be one woman that rules the *earth* (tesla said that), and that the vulcans like to hang out with anatau (that's me -- just I'm still in male form atm).
so, let's just assume that the girls do figure out how to make it all happen in california, and I stay here and just keep doing things that for me are only-attraction -- well then energy will continue to rise, and my entire body will become a reflection of my perception, and also the peal of the evolution-of-desire combination: I thought I needed girls way way back, then I thought I wanted them, but then around 2012 I figured out that *I* have all of the things that I thought I wanted from girls -- and combined with abraham's teachings, I realised that I am on the path to becoming the thing that I thought I wanted. this begun a series of events that would ultimately lead me to this realisation. for example, because andrea was pretty reflective originally, I perceived her as 1st-ray, but she was just a reflection of me -- so it's actually m5 that's 1st-ray. so I guess if I continue on, and am not slowed down by girls or sex or anything like that -- I'll eventually turn into the 1st-ray female. when then makes me become now become the source for their 1-5-7 (only-attraction) setup.
	I don't really have much of an opinion on this, as I know that a female body will be far more comfortable than the one that I'm in now -- and I guess it makes sense that I would then have all of me externalised out as infinite set of dudes out in lala-land. however, the thing that does annoy me the most about this "manifestation" (or lack thereof) is that I really wanted to build the thing. I've been so uncreative for so long, I *really want to create something*. my entire experience is that sex has always been destructive for anything that I want to create, and so I wish to stay away from it as much as possible, until I can actually get the things that I want to make built -- because the original point to wanting to create a body (masculine or feminine) is to make it possible for me to actually have sex, and not have that become cataclysmic. I recognise that sex is tremendously destructive, and my supposition of it comes from the way that the nuts produce a symbolic system to create arrousal, which then as energy flows through that system (either emissive or attractive), that's what causes all of the problems. for me the attractive energy flows in and then up to my brain completely rewriting the symbolic portion of my head -- which, because that's where a lot of the things that I want to create are located, and the place where nosebook's entire 2nd-ray system is located (which I'm fine with them inhabiting it), I don't really want to get that rewritten -- and neither do I want to be *emitting* a symbolic system, either. there is nothing about sex (with the nuts), which is something I want to be a part of -- so probably the reason for me hanging out with jaron so steadily, is because he's a huge dampner on my attractiveness. basically, around him, nothing will be happening with girls at all (which is what I want, until the nuts are removed).
so I'm fully supportive of this setup, actually -- because it's not really a problem for m5 if I take on a female body. they want me to be on earth with them, and don't want me to go out and be in any way superior to them, so everything does all work out quite well. also, it's really been kind of an issue for me the idea of me being a man, and then building essentially myself up to become *all* of the girls desire. it seems to work out OK in my head, but obviously when I go out into the world, and I meet women (or talk to remi or something like that), they're not all attracted to me -- so it does feel a bit pretentious.
in the system of "all or nothing" -- if "all" isn't actually realistic, then I will go for none, instead -- and that actually works out quite well in another way too, because there's only so much distance that they can hold me back -- and eventually, they have to actually let me go in some way toward wanted (I would suppose -- especially when the wanted aspect for me is to give them what they want (their own 2nd-ray system where they control everthing)) -- and if they want to infinitely block me, they need to infinitely come up with more and more ways of getting that energy under control (at the moment, their ability to block it, is so flimsy, it seems a dishwasher can upset their setup) which I'm also for as well (hence using the pen-rose to limit/distribute that energy rising over infinite diversity). however, what if they do not let me find a way to give them what they want, or find a way to hold me back either -- well then I have to become "the first and the last", "the beginning and the end" -- where I'm the last one out -- and then (I dunno for sure, but I have to imagine) a new universe will be created. if they maintain their course wanting to ensure that I forever get nothing, then it's the end for them; there's nothing I can do about that (I can't attract for them). they have all of the power though, so it's entirely up to them. do they want me to have all or none?

#### 2024-05-04 - may the fourth be with you

thm other major narrative thing that I adhere to is "nothing good comes from saturn". the way that I've come to realise that over the years, especially after reading a lot of shakespere and stuff,-- is that *all narratives* are basically bunk. they're a reflection of the author's desire, and can't really be considered worthwhile. it's quite likely that "fwh" (former white hat), that originally gave me my narrative around 2012-2013 was probably one of the antarctica mars guys. they've been around all my life, and have been constantly steering me (they're also the ones who run/operate the saturnian-system). it's pretty clear that they don't want me to be ending up with any XX reflector girls (like andrea), so that was probably pretty important for me to quickly identify marcos as having the archetype of saturn, and to be fully OK with that entire thing falling through ("nothing good comes from saturn") -- and so I find myself again in another situation where I'm presented with another opportunity (allie), but clearly paul and remi are undeniably of the archetype of saturn and venus -- so again, I have to pass (paso a paso!) -- and it's totally fine. the thing is, the other night, it really strongly felt like I was being forced into it -- and I just don't want that. not only do I not want to have sex with nuts, it's also been 100% true that sex has destroyod every single project that I ever tried to make, so I can't really do that. I want to create something.
	for marcos and andrea, this was quite the challenge for me. I really wanted to create a social network based on afinity -- more specifically of ideological proximity, but that seemed to have a lot of resistance to it. I decided that I'd settle for second-best on this one, and just make the affinaty project exactly how he wanted it. andrea really messed that up though for me, because I really wanted to do the technical stuff, but then things got really complicated (cause he claimed bogus stuff, and I felt the need to defend my honour, and say "no that really did happen" -- plus a whole bunch of other things like telling me what I experienced wasn't what I experienced -- which again, I felt the need to defend). all of that completely derailed my technical/creative efforts, and there wasn't even sex involved. basically, girls can be thought of (IMO) as the complete antithesis to creativity. the only time that I ever experineced good creative output was when I was up in arrasate with mom working on a 2.5D web-based RTS I wanted to create. things flowed really well at her house and stuff, but ultimately my own drinking habits are what caused that one to flounder. women who have believed in me have helped my creativity, but in all the cases it's worked, there wasn't any sex involved. well, OK, there was the time when raquel was working, and she'd leave for work and I'd program on her bed all day while she was gone -- but I didn't have as high of output there because I -- I dunno why actually, I don't remember accomplishing anything remarkable at all -- just I remember it was really fun that I could work all day, and then she'd come home, and I liked that -- which is why I asked if she wanted to come to madrid (a number of fails there). the most successful I've ever been at programming was actually when I was doing coke, and *not drinking* (very imprtant the not drinking part) -- which again was around the time of marcos, but he didn't want that code; he wanted something that he could hire others to program on as well, so I switched to ractive and actionhero.
basically, the way it works with the saturnian types is that they like to have control over everything -- which is about the same as mom's guardian-ship; just being the conceptual principality over the thing, she (or whoever is controlling her) has the abiltiy to totally derail everything. the events of affinaty felt nearly the same as the events around the whole "health solutions" thing and the dr-estrella switcharoo (the woman that I met was not asian at all). I've come to recognise the feeling that the saturnian-system leaves behind on the events that they meddle with, and I've come to realise that they (or whoever it is that mr-motor collectively is), does not want my to be creative on anything, so in a sense, saturn will always ensure that anything I want to do, never goes through. I've come to just accept this as fact by not, and the conclusion that I've come to over the years, is that saturn will ensure that there isn't any manifestation, basically until the opposition that's trying to keep me from being creative, all destroy theirselves.
my job, isn't to try and work out a deal with anyone (mutual-back-scratching), and it isn't to try and actually be creative (the reason why I've stopped programming), because it'll always get blocked anyway, so I've stopped trying to put effort into something that'll never go anywhere, anyway -- which leaves me with the only thing left, that I have any control over: I have the freedom to feel *any* way that I want to, which means that my job isn't to be creative, but it's actually to continue to lower resistance, until I'm as low resistance in waking state as I am in dream-state, where I'm telling them all sorts of cool designs and stuff, giving them answers to anything they want and stuff like that. the person tha I am in dream-state, is the kind of person that I *really am*; kenny has a lot of extra symbolic conditioning that says that I should be compensated, and should have some sort of reward, and all kinds of other symbolic/conditional things that should be met in order for us to have a good relationship -- but none of those exists when I'm in dream-state; I love everyone. that's the direction that I'm headed, and it's totally fine if they "take advantage of me" for the entire time.
the other thing that fwh told me is that I "have until 2038" -- which I've had a lot of different ideas on what that could possibly mean, but the general average of those ideas (and the fact that's the next solar maximum) is that, it's likely I have to just wait it out all the way until the bitter end; which is probably 2038.
along the way, one of the things that I want to do is to support as many people who want to take my ideas and turn them into something (because I'm incapable of doing it). I've stopped trying to get them done myself, so I really would like to see more cool and awesome technology while I'm waiting this thing out. I also kinda just supposed that I would spend a good portion of the time on drugs as well (or defocused in some way) -- but I'm kinda rethinking that one. I'm fairly certain that my destiny is fixed -- so no matter how much the saturnian-system adjusts things, I'm always going to the same spot. I just have to hold out to the very end, not needing any manifestations, and steering clear of saturn and his efforts.
	in a lot of ways, I have a bit of freedom with how things play out. basically, the way I've figured it out to be, is that kenny (the body) can do all sorts of things, but there are inflection points where I feel certain ways (think of these like rises and falls in a drama or musical piece -- [I wrote about it kinda too](../realm-forge/dungeons-4.md#2024-01-29-0105---fun-thought-experiment-narrator-without-a-voice)), so the way that I feel (the inflection points) is kinda fixed, and I can get to those points any way that I want (I can be destructive or creative or whatever), so really my entire focus is learning how to maximise my enjoyment (freedom to feel how I want to feel is always there, growth is inevitable, so the only thing left is joy) -- and I've tried different ways of maximising my enjoyment (drugs, sex, friends, creativity, etc), which have all been conditional, and nothing I've tried really matchs up to just feeling good about things becase I've adjusted my perception to be that way. it's totally fine for me that saturn doesn't want me to have sex, or be creative, or have and any good conditions, because those things don't determine how I feel about my situation. I like who I am, and have no interest in relying on (good) conditions to have a good time. [I'm aware that I described the inflection point as a feeling, and also my emotional state as a feeling. I don't know how to describe the difference between the two -- something maybe more like a velocity, though the point is the same] anyway, I'm basically just a robot that's going from one point to another in time, and I'm learning how to maximize my enjoyment of the traversal between points.
		or maybe some other metric, but I think it's probably enjoyment -- cause I figure I could end up in the same place/point also taking a destructive path -- and I may have even done this before, so I'm likely optimizing for the path that I want to take -- cause eventually, they won't be able to hold me back anymore, and I can do what I want; but obviously, if I took a destructive path, it's going to be much harder to pivot into something really awesome, than it is if I go the passive way.
			my thinking on this, is that being fully passive (ie, no manifestation at all, only-attraction), actually results in the most energetic final trajectory. there seems to be a lot of fluctuation in how I take the passive path, and that's actually likely why I learned about how to be passive (only-attraaction) about it so rapidly, because it's actually quite an art, and not as easy to do as one may think: the body, which is conditioned by the symbolic system its born into, has a lot of ideas about how things *should* be, and what are the conditions necessary to feel good -- and the conditioning tells us we need to feel really bad about a lot of really inconsequntial things. it's all mostly just realising that the things we think we "need", we don't actually need as bad as we're trained to believe we need them. relaxing and being passive is better than fighting for so many things.
	so basically, none of this really matters at all; just I'm really conscious, and the situation is really real, so part of the navigation to that fixed destiny is learning how to adjust my emotions to feel the right way, and writing helps a lot with that.

### 2024-05-05 06:06 - a play within a play

two entries ago, I talked about going/flying to utah, which is a direct contradiction to my idea of becoming "a plant, now fully planted". anyway the context for it is when I was talking to dad about jaron taking a bus or train up to utah, the idea of going with him to the shakespere festival up there, felt really good to me -- cause it felt like for the first time I can just talk and hang out with *real people*, where we share a common interest (shakespere), and not like how it is here where everyone is really sour and unwanting to talk about anything I like. I've always gotten along with the utahites pretty well, so just seemed to me like quite an enjoyable trip to make. I guess though, that makes me more like a potted plant or something -- anyway, after I hung up the phone, I was feeling the reactions to that idea, and one of them I translated as "he'll be like a fox in a hen house" -- and that kinda makes sense, because of mormonism and all of the sealing that goes on there, I would imagine that a very large percentage of the girls there are XX females -- which are the ones that by just being nearby to them, I feel very strong attraction to them -- which is actually really strong attraction to myself, because they're just reflectors (the younger they are, the better their reflection is) -- and apparently I really like myself. I don't know if they can feel it too, but nosebook has been really good at keeping me away from these girls.
	for example one time I saw one of those girls on the street (I was walking stoned through a neighbourhood that I've never been to before), and one of these girls was playing in the yard a few houses in front of me, and I could already start to feel her (she was prolly like 5-8yo). as soon as I noticed her, she seemed quite interested in me, then all of a sudden something came over her, and she ran inside. I doubt that I was the reason why she suddenly changed her feeling about me, and consider it more likely that the nosebook guys projected something fearful (to her) into the space between me and her, causing her to want to evacuate the area. additionally, when I was selecting the doctors for health solutions, I noticed dr-estrella, and when I tuned into her, she was one of these XX reflectors (and also looked asian) -- but the day that I got there, the dr-estrella was *not at all reflective* and was a venus type, instead.
what I've noticed over the years is that it seems that the saturnian-system guys have an ability to just create venus types, then they use their ability to move anyone with a pinecone around, and get any (good) reflectors, replaced with these scripted (non-reflective) venus types.
so, because it's pretty impossible for them to switch out such a large population of the utah girls, they're probably going to have to do something else, to ensure that nothing happens and I'm not around any reflectors. I figure their only real solution will be to create a completely artificial environment, just like the one that I'm in now -- and they'll have to put on a shakespere festival in the artificial environment, with all of the girls replaced with these venus types. so, because I'd be going in july or so, it would literally be "a midsummer's night's dream" where the mechanicals are going to be putting on a play (shakespere festival) within a play (the "reality" that I live in). I've been to these plays within a play before (though I can't concretely remember where, so perhaps an aborted timeline?) and I remeber that it was absolutely hilarious watching all of these venus types try and pretend to be real people, and at the same time stay clear of topics that I want to talk about -- sorta like talking to remi, actually.
my interest in going to the shakespere festival, is probably for the comedy aspect of it (for me) -- and at the same time, I would imagine that while I go to the play within a play (I'm probably bottom), there is going to be another actor that is playing me, which goes to the real shakespere festival in utah (so probably comedy and enjoyment for you all as well). however, the reason why I wrote about it, is today when I woke up, I noticed that I'm actually not as interested in going anymore -- though, I may still do it, just for the laughs (obviously nothing will happen, so it's actually fine (maximise enjoyment, right?))

### 2024-05-06 08:04 - actually, prolly not

yesterday I was thinking about this idea,-- and although it could be kinda funny, I'm not really doin it for the laughs anymore. humour is great and stuff, but there's one thing that I noticed while watching shakespere's plays (especially the tragedies), is that some of the parts that I find hilarious, others don't seem to share the same sentiment -- so it causes problems. well, the same thing here: the things that I find hilarious about shakespere's plays will almost certainly conflict with what some of the utahites think about the play -- so I hate to be the only guy that's laughing in the middle of a tragedy scene ("grab my sword by the hilt and run me through with it" -- lol). at the same time, I often notice that humour is just lost on a lot of things, and the things that I find funny aren't the same things that others find funny. for example, yesterday I made a joke about the stool I broke not being completely broken (cause it's not), but it's on it's last leg. mom, totally didn't even get the joke, and I just felt kinda silly, and even bad for her, because I made the joke so obvious, I expected her to get it. it just doesn't suit me too well on that end, because if I'm going to be hanging around with a bunch of venus types, when I'm out in utah the jokes are going to all be lost, and I don't want to be the only one laughing at the jokes. I was also thiking about how abraham would not really use humour or sarcasm when they would talk -- and the few times that they did, it just didn't come out right (the reason being that they speak very clearly and accurately, and humour is usually around the element of surprise because of something unexpected, or a dual meaning -- which is *not clear communication*) -- so, along with sarcasm, they preferred to communicate clearly and effectively, instead of joking around. I think I'm actualy transitioning into the phase where I'm more serious now too -- prolly because what I say is increasing in accuracy -- so to try and go back to using humour feels like it derails a lot of my points (cause sometimes, especially when talking to jaron, I purposefully derail the points). resorting to humour as a way to feel good (especailly at someone else's expense) kinda like a step in the wrong direction for me now.
the other major contributing factor is that shakespere is notably saturnian, and I also have to imagine that saturnian types are all over the place in utah, because of the sealing. in fact, I think it's even sorta required that all men coming back from mission will have gone through the initiation sealing, which means that the vast majority of males in the LDS church will be saturnian in perspective (if they're also emitters). I guess that's not *really* what I want, so again: paso.
I want to hold out till the very very end, and even yesterday when talking to mom about my situation and living in the house with me brothers and stuff, I was explaining to her, that for me it's just no problem the situation that I'm in now: I don't really need to fight anyone anymore, and if I had to move out, I'd be sad to see all of the weeds go away. I've been growing more and more comfortable here in the last weeks because of m/ *change in perception*. it all started with the concept of me figureing out how to "obey" -- but then, now I've figured out how to basically just always be doing what I want to be doing, getting me pretty close to pure-desire (there are still some other rough edges, but they'll get worked out). that concept btw, of only doing what I want to do and feeling good about my situation and where I'm at, is going to be the major archetype that I want for the solar (Z) girls, -- as if they're able to accomplish that (along with not needing others/conditions to change and just feeling-purposefully), then that's the foundation of having the pure-desire perspective. my situation right now offers me the perfect set of circumstances to accomplish that form of perception for myself (cause hate to say it, I don't really like telling people to do things, I myself am not capable of doing). I really like the time that I have here, and I'm actually learning a lot in the process. also, I really like doing the yard work, and thinking about these ideas and writing them down (like I did yesterday).
the other thing that I really like about my situation, is that it actually gives the girls a chance to do it theirselves. ideas (for me) are free, and it's the implementation that's the difficult part -- so along with the realisation yesterday that it's probably best to just do a fixed size one, then launch another off later on, it actaully works out kinda nice if they are capable of working out the first version, because there will always be continual improvements, and we can just launch more off to try out new things. -- maybe, we'll eventually create so many of these mirrors, it'll be sorta like a dyson sphere for the universe (ironic joke... :)) honestly, who knows what'll come of it, -- so I figure I'll probably just keep tanking for as long as is necessary (cause it seems they don't want me working on any of that cool stuff, because that cool stuff is top secret, and I'm broadcasted). if I just write out crazy ideas here, I'm just a loon.
for me, I don't *need* to be the first one to do anything -- and I don't care to have my name on anything, or any kind of recognition, or anything like that (Unlicense and WTFPL dual license), so -- I really am hoping that they can turn these ideas into reality -- as it'd just be really awesome for me, because then I wouldn't have to deal with all of the constant resistance (I stopped programming, because it's not fun or enjoyable anymore -- so if I'm going to try and maximise enjoyment, there's no sense in trying to do something unfun). so yeah, I'd love to work on it, but it's totally not necessary for me to "spearhead" (lol) the first version or anything like that.

### 2024-05-07 04:33 - the death of juliet

this morning I woke up with a strong sense that the allie thing will probably go though, but it seems that they don't want me tto actually try and organise the creation or the launch of the black-mirror -- and I'm supposed to just "trust" (them) that it'll work out.
	there are a whole lot of problems that I have with "trust", because I don't really "trust" anybody. trust requires an agreem5nt, and I have none of those (cause nobody will talk to me), so there's literally no way that I can trust anybody (cept myself). in fact, the only person that I really "trust", is myself -- and I don't really "trust" myself in the traditional sense of the word. I have confidence in myself that things always work out, and that even when it looks like everything is lost, I still find a way, etc. -- but that's not trust at all -- more like confidence (or delusion). the last thing that I'm ever going to start doing is to start to trust someone who has consistently shown that they're liars. it would be like, if I had to "trust" mom, cause in my opinion, she's not trustworthy. just look at the whole guardian-ship thing, and notice that when she's the principality over the thing, everything goes terribly wrong, and nothing works out according to my attraction. (it's fine in the end, because I realize I didn't want to start to rely/trust a medical system to solve my problems; the title says "solutions", but they were anything butt). in the end, I just can't trust any of these guys ever. I don't trust anything symbolic at this point (and that includes all agreements). I don't seem capable of being good at my word on agreements (I can only go in the direction of what's wanted), and I cannot seem to get others to be good at their word, either. mutual-back-scratching, and any sort of agreement just doesn't work for me.
		I've actually been thinking about this in the context of how I will talk to allie, because in the normal (agreement) way of doing things, I'd make an agreement or a deal with her, and say, "OK, I want to create this black-mirror-idea, and historically I've had sex destroy every project I wanted to work on, so in exchange for not having sex, I'll give you whatever you want" -- but that sorta sounds like an agreement or a deal to me, so I've realised actually that I need to just state my desire: "I want to create the black-mirror-idea, so for me that means not having sex. I figure once I figure out what's going on energetically (which is part of the necessary requirements to creating the black-mirror), we can have sex then. apart from that, I'll give you whatever you want" -- and just leave it at that. I state what I want, and make it completely unconditional: this is what I want, and I'm going toward that (end of story), and then just feel-purposefully from then on out.
	what does work for me though, is going in the direction of what I want (ie, what I *really* want). I've noticed over the years that a lot of the things that I thought that I wanted, I didn't *really* want them (tuenti, every girl I was with, nosebook's compliance with my demands, etc.), and so I've found that really the thing that actually works, is to just feel the way I want to feel -- and trust in the way I feel, as the propellant toward the future. however, if allie is involved, I don't really know how to deal with that, because I lose myself around other people, and I don't really know how *I* feel anymore -- cause I feel them so strongly. so, she's either going to become an extension af myself, and feel the way that I want to feel (if we're hanging out a lot), or I'll have to remove myself from her (because I don't want to feel the way that she feels). a lot of her feeling the way I want to feel (confident in myself, successful, not needing others/things to feel good, etc) will have to come with some massive changes to the way that she perceives life. I don't know if she's capable of that, and neither do I know if she wants to actually do it either -- but for the rest of this entry, I'm just going to assume she does (or someone around me does).
so, let's just assume for a moment that somehow it all works out, and that I am able to work on the black-mirror-idea, well, I imagine that about the time that I make the transition into working on the idea, that'll probably be around the time of the split -- because the saturnian crew probably won't be wanting any evidence that anything good came out of my efforts (cause that would teach people to be passive and not constantly fight against their efforts to manipulate) -- so *it'll get reangled to fit their narrative, for sure*. however, I don't think that all girls will go away at all -- but probably more like how it is here, they'll all get replaced with venus types (scripted girls that behave properly, and follow their symbolic programming). earth girls will continue to exist as well, because any strong emitter will produce a mars or aphrodite, and they probably want mars, but not aphrodite (though they can probably control the gender at this point) -- so maybe not.. dunno
	you know, one of the strange things about my time in utah is that the majority of the girls that are there are all of the archetype of aphrodite (XX reflector), and they go off to these missions and they get symbolically trained and put into the LDS system, and go home to become someone's wife. now, that someone is always going to be at least a vulcan or a saturn in perception, which is an odd combination, especially if he's a saturn. normally, saturn is paired with a venus, because she's symbolically trained to do all of the things that he needs her to do for him -- and it works out, because she was (symboically) created by him, and is therefore a reflection of him in a lot of ways, so she amplifies his own beliefs by reflecting them back to him (girls are annoying -- she's annoying; jesus is my saviour -- she helps him find more jesus, etc) -- but the mormons have essentially pioneered a way to get aphrodite girls (XX) to behave like venus girls (XY). an interesting thing indeed -- and it seems to work pretty well too (I think it has to do with the 2nd-ray installation, which has a lot of "good" and ideal ideas in it). it's possible that such a 2nd-ray intallation could work on earth, but I find it kinda doubtful that nosebook would actually come up with such a system with that much good or ideals in it.
venus girls (which saturn can create), can also produce vulcan girls, so they'll also be around, if vulcan girls are desired (they may actually become the alternative -- though not sure) -- but the thing that I have a pretty difficult time seeing is a cOntinual presence of solar girls. 
one of the main archetype changes that I can see happening (especially if the allie thing goes through), is that I've noticed that more and more of the solar girls are starting to go in the direction of "only doing what they want to be doing" and feeling-purposefully -- and I think it's a trend that'll continue on increasing (especially once the black-mirror exists) -- so I actually find it more and more improbable that they'll keep showing up here on earth at all. I don't know how much the black-mirror will affect the rest of the universe (there are billions and billions and billions of stars, so it could take a while), but just imagine a transition where solar girls just sorta stop showing up, because they're all doing the things that they want to be doing now, and don't need to sacrifice to create what they want. combine that with the fact that romeo (earth) also peaces out (ie, when saturn reangles my trajectory to fit some BS narrative), I think I finally understand what the play is really attracting (I think a lot (all?) of the tragedies are this way, actually).

### 2024-05-07 22:23 - thinking about my current situation (again)

I use the blahblog files especially to kinda talk things out. today, I started out digging up the crappy grass in the back back yard -- and something strange that I haven't been so conscious of experiencing since I was back in tuenti -- is that I just set my mind to doing the work, and I just kept doing things, then all of a sudden I sorta wake up from a stupor or meditative state or something, and a whole bunch of work is done. I remember doing it, and when I look at the ground, I remember separating that specific part of grass from the mud and all that -- so it's nothing magical or anything like that, just the steady progress while I'm in a sort of focused state (focused on what I'm doing -- though thoughts are coming into my head, I'm entirely focused on swinging the axe and pulling separating the dirt, grabbing the bucket, etc) -- and in that state, it just seems like I get an awful lot done in the same amount of time, as when I'm normally focused on the motors, and thinking about something else, and stuff like that. I seemed to have pretty good ease of going in and out of that state all day, and basically everything really feels easy. in addition to that, I'm starting to have a serious transition in how my "memory" works. I can often times remember things that are necessary and stuff, but I'm really only focused on what I'm doing now -- and that seems to be pretty productive (feels kinda like I do twice the amount in the same period of time), but it's getting harder and harder to remember irrelevant points in my past -- and I can't really put the events that happened in chronological order, without thinking about it, and linking together the fragments of memory using logic (I had to have done this first, because I remember X happened later). things are definitely becoming more and more *now* focused. it also seems to be having an effect on jaron as well (perhaps he's not as capable of being now-focused so much, and perhaps looses track of reality or something -- not sure).
(brb - 22:38) later on, while pulling weeds at remi's house I also started to get into that kind of now-focused sort of mindset, and it really started to become apparent to me that I'm definitely living on pluto, and the entire thing is just sort of a magical environment where the guys that have the capability, seemingly just conjure the stuff that they want (new car, or whatever) and it just works. I even tuned into the massive computer installations that they have here -- because once the technology is created on earth, the thing (whatever it is) can just be conjured. so they can just get millions of the new intel servers or whatever, just by creating them mentally. I also noticed that there are all kinds of astral machines that occupy the same space as physical space too -- so I may be looking at something like a box, and it appears empty, but inside of it is a machine that does something. I can't see them, but the majority of them seem to be some kind of resonators or something -- and then there are other things too, where property lines have distinct dividing lines between them, and (back when we had it) snow would melt differently on different properties, and weeds grow differently, and there's a definitely different feel between one property and another.
the more I'm beginning to perceive what's not physically there, the more I realise that this entire place I'm in is a completely artificial environment. I think it's probably possible that everything that I receive (all my emails and everything) are completely filtered out or blocked or something -- cause I just am not getting any emails from anyone other than --- seemingly someone approved or something. the last person [I've talked to was andy](../world-net/geometry-workspace.md) -- and as soon as I started writing about him, he stopped responding. very strange stuff. I guess you could say that I feel pretty isolated, but it's actually kinda awesome, because I'm finding the fact that fewer and fewer people want to be around me, to be kinda refreshing. I literally just do yard work all day, cause I really like how it feels to just do things with my body (as opposed to sitting or layying around).
	I took a break from yard work this afternoon and decided to sit in the garage (the chair that I picked up with greg a while back). when I sat in the chair, I noticed the the chair got moved, cause the energy felt way different. I moved it back to where I liked the energy and noticed that I had intuitively placed the chair so that I'm sitting parallel (just below) to the point of the garage roof. that got me thinking about the great pyramid, and when I went to giza in my mind, I noticed that the pyramid wasn't in shambles at all, looked really nice, and had all of its casing stones and everything. I then started to ponder about how here there seems to be a symbolic parallel world to the one that's on earth, but because it's symbolic (2nd-ray), everything looks considerably nicer. the garage door was open, cause I noticed I liked how it felt with it open -- so I just sat there and was thinking about it. paul called his cat, then a few minutes later opened his garage, but I stayed in my train of thought -- then jaron coughed really loudly -- but still fine -- then greg suddenly wanted to start looking for nails in the garage. I still maintained my train of thought, so greg initiated conversation with me "are you OK?" I told him I was fine, the roped him into a conversation about changing up a few things in the back yard that are kinda bothering me energetically. in the process, he was telling me another really bizarre story about how he had to pay $700 to install the air conditioner, and he did everything -- then he said the only thing the guy did was put these fastners on and some zip ties -- but I know that's not true because the zip ties were added only a few months ago, when another tube going into greg's shed appeared (the guy installed it like last year, so impossible). greg also said that he was the one that put the black spray mark on the shed -- when again, I know that's not possible because the spray mark happened when I walked over to the metal shed, while the guy was working on it, and he was fumbling with his tools and stuff while I watched him, and he made the spray while I was there -- so it couldn't have been greg. in fact, watching that guy make the spray mark (along with a few other blunders) is how I figured out that the repair guys here don't actually know how to use their tools, because they do everything mentally. I walk away, and magically it's done, and really well, but when I come to see them work, they have no idea even how to use the tools (or are just pretending to use them). anyway, the next bizarre thing that greg claimed is that one time when it rained really hard, "the whole yard was covered in water" -- and I told him, no it's only about a 10x20ft space that was flooded, and mom had some guys come out to dig out some trenches so the water could leak out -- but again greg claimed that no, he dug the trenches, claiming that he had to use the axe to do it, when the trenches are under a chain link fence, so I don't know how he did that, because the fence is in the way; there's no space for an axe to swing. I have no idea why greg keeps saying that he's doing all of this work which I clearly watched other guys do. very bizarre, but he did distract me from my thoughts about being on pluto and how the pyramid works and stuff.
the major thought that I was having while sitting in the garage chair is, I was thinking about the hercules (1997) narrative, where herk decides that he wants to stay on earth with meg. so in this example, let's say that I'm herk, and meg is allie: I'm thinking to myself, OK, so they're trying to get us together so that she (like the prostitues while I was working on tuenti) would bring me back down to physical/flat perception again, when/if we have sex -- and I'm back to being on earth again. then, there's the narrative in the-tick of the monkey that goes to space and is really smart, but upon returning to earth, goes back to being a stupid monkey again (and they make him head of the space program) -- well, imagine I'm the monkey, and the whole point is to put me back on earth where I'm not out in the more energetic (outer) part of the solar system. that brings m5 to the next narrative that I created of [verdan-forest](../shake-sphere/plays/verdan-forest.md) where we're in a bubble and "the-city" is all around us. so, if we look at this now from the solar perspective, if I'm going to the inner bubble, then that's going to be essentially everything from tiamat inward (mercury, venus, earth, mars) -- but according to shakespere, some time before juliet dies (see previous entry), mercutio/mercury bites the dust first -- which makes perfect sense to me because how in the world is something narrated going to continue on like that. I also would imagine that venus will undergo some massive changes as well -- and the inhabitants on venus will have to migrate to the the-city (the outer planets). but then, because I had the great pyramid on my mind, I was thinking about how I'd really like to dismantle the great pyramid, if I'm going to earth -- which again is in another narrative: the [lost book of enki](../nextdocs/sitchin/lost-book-of-enki.md) where ninurta (mars) dismantles the pyramid. the pyramid just isn't what I want to be doing on the planet, and I'd prefer to completely remove the atomospheric layer as we know it, and drop the ionnosphere down to ground level. that'd make every inhabitnt of the earth living inside of the conceptual space which the saturnian-system runs on. also the south pole will need to be changed, and a few other things. it'll become a blend of physical and conceptual in the same space, instead of how it is with the great pyramid, where the astral is symbolically defined, so as to create a medium with a finite speed of light (without it, light speed will be infinite).
	my thinking about dismantling the great pyramid certainly got some reactions to it -- because it means they won't have the ability to control us the way that they do presently. they'll be much more limited, to only using physical/tangible things and vibrations, and concepts (hydrogen) -- which, because they live in the symbolic (outer planets), any concepts that they change for us, they're also doing it to theirselves.
so here's the deal: they don't want me to do the black-mirror, cause that'll make them the ones in the center, and us the ones on the outside superior -- but not really though, because we're only attraction; it'll be the 2nd-ray installation which is a reflection of them which will be superior or ideal than they are. so they want me on earth instead, cause they think they can control us easier that way -- which is also fine, but if I'm on earth, I'm going to eventually turn it into a reflection of myself -- and while I may be a little less sharp, if I'm as sharp as I was after the prostitutes in tuenti, I'm still *really really smart* -- cause even still I was putting really profound concepts into code. I don't feel it's a problem.
then later tonight, when thinking about what I would write here (I decided to go long and tell as much as I can), I thought about the other narrative of the sirian-guide, cause there are two things that caught my eye: first, they say that a 2nd-ray can really learn to enjoy depression/suppression (the idea of being held back), which seems to imply that the 2nd-ray (I guess that's me), can learn to not need conditions to change in order to feel the way they want to feel. -- which somehow seems to imply that I'll be spending some time out here, longer than was narrated otherwise. cause like, my even before remembering that narrative today, I've been planning to just stay put for as long as I can out here. I don't see any reason to try and go anywhere else, as every day for me here is just getting easier and easier. I don't really care as much about anything anymore, and I figure that all of it can wait until I figure out what's going on and can make an educated decision -- though, I imagine I won't have to, because I suppose I'll just attract it. the second thing is about how it's time for humans to become receptive -- which, I can only imagine, that if I just stay put, and don't try to do anything, eneryg will keep rising, and all of the emitters will be blowing harder than ever, which (in the saturnain-system) probably leads to receptivity.
another narrative that I thought of is the one where innana descends into the underworld, and somehow turns men into women and women into men -- well, a long time from now, let's just imagine that the black-mirror-idea becomes a reality, and there are various 2nd-ray reflectors pointing at earth, and they're essentially collecting the souls of the universe into their 2nd-ray system (as a sort of heaven/afterlife), and there entites slowly begin to make their transition into only-attraction, and are born again on to the physical side, probably in female form -- then also all of the females that are there are going to be slowly gaining genetics that are also similar to mine (asd coming up with new ones too), cause only-attraction (barbies) are going to have very voloptuous bodies, there will be a gradient of women that are attractive, to others that are only-attraction -- and the only-attraction ones will be able to be like me, and have any form that they want -- so they too could become men, as well. that's another way to gain receptivity.
the last narrative that I thought of just before I wrote that last bit is a bit more sinister, cause in [dtp](../nextdocs/dtp/dtp.md), it talks about how at the end there's plenty of time to make the transition, and the ones that don't want to make it, will be (can't remember the words -- burnd or something about a crystal that deletes anything and sends it back to its source).
so, there you have it: it seems that my initial intutiion is correct, and I'm really desiring to just wait it out and stuff while I'm out here. I'm going to try and reangle my approach because I no longer feel anne anymore, so I'll just write my ideas to myself instead :) however, if disney is right and I end up making back to earth with meg, all is not lost at all, and I'm sure it'll only be time before the black-mirror (or something better) becomes a reality. I really want to create that (or something better) -- and if I have to wait it out or whatever, I guess that's cool with me -- and: OH well, I guess there's next time :)

#### 2024-05-08 13:50 - so what is it that I actually want?

it's the next day now, and instead of running out to do a bunch of work like I would have, I've been plagued with thinking about -- OK, well, if I'm not actually going to be staying here, then do I *really* want to go out and do yard work? for me, I think the answer is yes, because I really like how it feels (even though it's completely for nought). so then what are my goals then? well, I *could* just take the easy road, and just run away from the situation (though, details on how that cOuld possibly work out, are really cloudy) -- but then I'm still the same person that I am now (with considerable resistance), just in a new place. the nice thing that I've come to actually appreciate about my situation is that I'm actually forced to become lower and lower resistance.
	one of the things that I've noticed from all of the experience that I've had with my dream-state, is that in that state, I really don't find almost anything to be a problem at all. I'm constantly giving nosebook (greg, and the others that are controlling my life) more and more solutions to be able to contol me more. you would think that I *wouldn't* want to help them, but it feels alright, and as if nothing is going wrong. the difference between that state and normal state, is that normal state, I have all sorts of symbolic things that I think *should be*, or I need to have some condition met, before I'll give some information or whatever -- but in that state, I'm completely unconditional. I just don't really care about them getting a perecived (symbolic) edge/advantage on me at all
		probably cause it's all attraction anyway, so any perceived advantage that they seemingly have is only their own attraction, as I'm not symbolically/conditionally resisting it. for example: if they are asking for a solution of how to control me, then they're doing that out of a perceived (or fear of) loss of control -- which is what they're attracting more of. even if I give them the solution to give them more conditional/symbolic control, it won't be too long before their own attraction (a perceived (or fear of) loss of control) will get worse. no amount of conditions can solve their emotional/conceptual state, without a change in perception.
	I give them and others all kinds of tips on how to improve their perception on a subject as well, because again, it's no difficulty for me and actually improves m5 in the process; because in teaching it to them, I'm also refining and making more concrete my own techniques for improving my perception. it's really no big deal for me.
 however, if/when I'm around girls all the time, I won't have the same opportunity I have now to keep lowering resistance, because girls are easy. sure, some are annoying at times, or can be very demanding, but I don't really mind that so much. however, if a guy does the same thing, then I find it considerably more annoying -- and I'm not sure why that is.
	what I actually find most annoying about girls (which neither will be a problem), is when I'm considerably more awesome than the competition, yet they continue to pick the dolts over me -- but I've learned that has a lot to do with reflectivity, and attraction: for example, if she believes she's no good, or terrible, then she'll attract guys that are the same way as her. it doesn't matter how great I am, unless I can find a way to also see myself as no good and terrible, I'm not even considered. or, another example, if I'm looking for a girl that has some sort of difficult to find (rare) qualities, then she too (being a reflection of me) will also see me in the same way -- yet if a guy comes over to her with an "I'll take anything I can get" sorta mindset, then she (being a reflection of him) will look at him and think, "wow, I'll take what I can get -- and here he is". also I should be clear that I don't really find any of that very annoying anymore, because I see it all as attraction now.
so if I just chill out and just keep going here, then I get a lot of opportunities to continue to lower my resistance to where I'm like how I am in a dream-state. that's actually quite a valuable thing for me to accomplish, actually. I've come such a distance just learning how to become as low of resistance as I am now (knowing that it's all attraction), that I may as well use the opportunity that I have and just keep it going for as long as possible. plus, there are a few narratives about that -- most notably the one where neo is flexing and bending spacetime in the matrix, while the nebuchadnezzar is getting torn to bits by the robosquids -- or like milton in office space who never gets his red stapler (the things I've repeatedly requested), and so decides to burn the place down.
I don't really need to have any rush to any of this. they're the ones that put me where I'm at, and they're the ones who have to remove me, too. I want to create something, and since I'm in a location where I'm a genius poet-ape, why not take advantage of the space-genes?
I figure (and it's been a long question on my mind this morning), is if I'm going to go back to earth and be back to a shallow guy that's barely socailly perceptive again, I really think I want to stay out here for a while and continue to work on some of the ideas: do a lot more on the-manual-v2 (coming soon), and other projects and stuff too. learning to enjoy their symbolic system, is the key to lowering my resistance. --- but then, the other thing to think about is, if I'm on earth and I'm wanting to create stuff, they're probably not going to want that, so they'll probably be fighting that (which means I'll probably have enough chance to lower resistance with any setbacks we could potentially encounter).
I dunno... I'm still really on the fence on this one. I keep wanting to go for the "worst" -- so it feels wrong to me, to just be like "hey bea how's it going" -- (or whoever responds to me). it is obvious though that here isn't the right spot for me (nothing good comes from saturn) -- but then again... I dunno.

### 2024-05-08 16:59 - pues nada I guess

I decided I would try and message bea a few hours ago,-- so I pulled up her messenger profile, and the picture is red, and has a lot of feeling associated with it. originally I was going to write "hey bea how's it going" -- but I noticed some old messages: I messaged her in 2013 and sent her a picture of me with a beard and a thumbs up. I dunno how I managed to look that good (I was a wreck back then), and I was probably high, because I don't remember sending that picture, taking it, or writing the message. then mirroring my falseness, she responds something like, "you look funny with a beard. I'm trying to survive the spanish (economic) crisis. I also wonder about you from time to time and one day I'm sure one day your name will be very famous. saludos	:)"	-- so then (I must have been pretty high cause) I responded back by saying I hope that one day to hear news that bea has become a world renowned designer and stuff -- then I launched off into some rehashed abraham ideas about her looking at not where she is but where she wants to go (I must have sensed some inferiority in her saying that one day my name will be really famous) and then some words of "encouragement" -- to which she promply never responded. I can't blame her honestly, cause I was a total wreck, trying to recover using abraham's message while living at augustos and doing lots of drugs. but once again, notice the constant mirroring -- as it really took a lot of alcohol and dani practically pushing me toward her for us to even start talking in the first place. anyway, after reading those messages, seeing the picture of me a long time ago, and trying to feel what I was originally going to write in relation to her, I decided that writing in english has had a near 100% failure rate of her responding. when writing in spanish, I often times didn't make much sense, and so I should probably write in spanish. thinking about that, I tried to feel her, and now I'm essentially feeling her facebook/messenger profile, and how that persona interacts with people -- and I'm just like "naw, it's not gonna work" -- because the person that I feel when I would talk to her on messenger, isn't the same person that I feel [when writing to her](../shake-sphere/dear-bea.md) -- so I'm just like "nope" -- and I fell asleep.
when I woke up, I had an idea to write to her asking if she wants to talk to me -- so I translate the concept into spanish, "hola bea, quieres hablar conmigo?" -- then the responce was something like "sure what do you want to talk about" -- to which I would say, "no lo se -- por eso te preguntaba a ti" -- then another resoponce which I don't know how to translate into english or spanish (prolly something like "nose q decirte"), and so I end the conversation "pues nada" and just leave it at that.
	though that conversation happened in my head, the results are fairly accurate according to how I feel her messenger profile. I don't know if that's how she'll actually respond or not, but I don't really care.
I realise that "the medium is the message" -- and similar to how it was when I was talking to angie, the way that I feel her at a distance determines how I talk to her -- and so I just have to not do that.
after that, I make the realisation that I'm basically going to be in my situation until the very final minute (just like neo, and peter getting saved by milton burning the place down). I really have to wait until they kick me out, because here I can only talk to people that are around (all mars, vulcan, venus and saturn types -- all members of the saturnian-system), and none of them seem to like me -- then, if I try to communicate with anyone over a distance, I have to use a social media platform, and those mediums strongly shape the way that my concepts get formatted. they've locked all of the communication mediums down pretty well, which makes it pretty difficult for m5 to actually have a conversation with anyone (I tried discord and messenger so far, and both didn't work. I'm sure facebook won't work, cause I watch jaron use it all the time, and I haven't tried the new twitter/X platform). so, I decide that I'm just gonna enjoy my time here, because they're the only ones that can take me out of it, or let me go -- and go do some yardwork. outside, I was getting reactions as to why I've gone back to yardwork instead of trying to get out of their matrix.
	the long answer for this is I'm getting closr only-attraction now, and there's no real reason for m5 to fight against them -- and if you could imagine that this whole thing is a giant simulation (designed by me) where the bad-guys are specifically programmed to ensure that I cannot be using conditions, they'll never let me out (no matter how much it hurts them, cause that's how they're designed), I have to just play this one out until the very last moment. I'm really not concerned, and it even seems kinda fun.

### 2024-05-09 04:33 - the biggest-picture yet

last night, I carried on with the simulated conversations in my head for a while -- and one of the angles that I decided to try would be to ask bea was if she wanted to come over to visit me here.
	a long time ago (06-18-2009), I must have sent bea a message, (probably) requesting that we speak things clearly (decir las cosas claras), cause I remeber at that time I couldn't figure out how to talk to anyone, and I just wanted *someone* to talk to me plainly and openly. nobody I knew would just talk to me, and I was really trying to get bea to start doing that too, but she liked to remain hidden and keep large portions of her life a secret. anyway, it looks from the messages that I just keep trying to talk to her more and more clearly -- even one time being so bold as just asking her "hey I'm coming to tenerife, can I sleep at your house?" -- to which she responded "nope" (lol). I do remember that period of my life I just kept getting more and more frustrated that nobody wanted to speak clearly, and I was starting to dispair a bit on how in the world I would ever find anyone that would be compatible with me (ie, who can speak clearly) -- anyway, reading those conversations inspired me to just speak to her (in my mind, simulating conversations with that facebook profile)
so I asked her if she wants to come over to visit me here in the usa, but I absolutely do not want to have sex or anything like that (cause the sense that I get is that in all of the conversastions that are on messenger, with all of my requests to see her and stuff like that, she must have thought that every one was with the intention to eventually have sex), and so I explained that I have various/many reasons why I don't want to have sex, which I can explain. she said she wanted me to explain. I explained that (I may sound a bit paranoid but) I live in an artificial reality where everything is cmopletely controlled, and I don't really do a whole lot, but one of the things that I've come up with here is a new project that's quite ambitious, and I really want to do it (called the black-mirror), and I've noticed a pattern in the past where sex has consistently derailed every project I've ever worked on, and the ones that worked out, have been without sex -- so no sex. I've been over a decade without it (probably longer depending on your definition of sex), and I really have no intention of returning back to it until my project is complete. -- anyway, after some conversing a bit, the idea comes up that k-prime is really "liada con su novio" (tied up with her boyfriend) -- and that got shot me off into a whole diffreent set of conversations. one reaction was like "what do you think?" I'm like, "well, if I knew about her before, then I suppose I'd have a reaction to it, but I never knew her, and if that's what she wants, then that's what she wants". I don't interfere with other people in that way. she is (in my opionion) of the age where she's old enough to make her own decisions, so I have nothing to say.
	I also talked a little bit about my sisters and how I just have to let them go and figure out their own way of doing things. (incomplete)
at that time, I had a pretty big realisation as to why it's that way, and so I explained it in terms of earth: the reason why the earth has become the centre of the universe, is because earth girls are basically willing to sleep with anyone. they're naive and easily deceived, such that it's really easy to take advantage of them. because earth is a reflection of the rest of the universe, each time that happens, the earth is gaining more and more density, by being the receiver of so many of these guys vibrations -- which it then turns into their desire for them (earth always gives them what they want). well, I too am just like the earth girls too, in that I reflect all of their vibration and give them what they want. each time that the earth girls and the earth vulcans absorb their energy, the earth (which is reflective) is containing all of their energy, ensuring that all of these guys are born into (reflective) mars bodies [I'm not happy with this explanation. I'll explain it again/better in the future]
after that I explained the big-picture of what's happening: somewhere a long time ago (I would imagine around the time of jesus), a new set of bad-guys got introduced to earth, worse than the infected-ones, and they are designed (by me) to absolutely ensure that I (earth) never ever get any good conditions: the earth girls are to always be with dolts, and the earth boys (mars and vulcan) are also never to get what they want either, which is why they have to form factions and symbolic systems, continually fighting over conditions amongst each other.
	so, just to explain, the saturnian guys, construct these mercury and venus types to ensure that the conditions of earth are the way they want them to be. mercury (forget about venus for now) is a scripted emitter, and so when he's sent off to sabotage these earth girls and guys, when the earth absorbs their energy (usually though sex -- like k-prime and her bf in the simulation), it's absorbing the saturnian guys energy as well -- with the long result is that all saturnian guys are actually occupying mars' (aryan) body, and so therefore are now reflective.
therefore, when these guys are all in the same faction (circle of trust), then being reflective of one another is fine -- but if they get around someone like me, then they become a reflection of me -- which they definitely do not want to do, because I contain all of their attributes, but in a more improved state,-- and for whatever reason, they don't want to improve, or let anyone else have any superiority on them. I'm a serious problem for them, because I'm constantly improving, so it's taking exponentially more and more effort to keep me down.
now, the way the saturnian-system works, is that they can move theirselves around in time by adjusting things to the symbolic system that they want -- and if they can get others to believe that symbolic system is real and has power, all those that believe their illusion, join them in their timeline. so when these guys are all ensuring that I (or anyone else) don't have an advantage on them, they're isolating themselves, by getting others to believe their illusion: "we're the ones that believe that the conditions of the earth are divided up according to our agreements" -- and they setup amongst theirselves their agreements, deciding what that will ultimately be, and each time the people that have a different (LOA-based -- the stuff that jesus originally taught) perception of reality, don't get included into that timeline; they get replaced by a mercury or venus (and the cycle repeats).
so, now, looking at this from my perspective, I'm the #1 proponent of a perspective that doesn't work inside of their symbolic system -- and so they have to continually ensuring that I never gain any control or power on earth, which will rival or put into jeapordy their setup -- so they have to keep sabotaging anything I want -- which is fine. eventually, they're going to be able to take everything away from me and ensure that I don't get any of the stuff that I've attracted; and that will be a timeline all of their own. on that timeline, they win completely, and have totally defeated me, which can only exist in a symbolic system, without any attraction, and so they'll find theirselves entirely inside of their own system.
now, when it comes to details, if indeed k-prime exists, there is no possible way that they'll be able to let me around her (either she or I would be too powerful), so they have to keep her in their system. I figure that besides her though, all the other women (by the time they've completely defeated me) will have either died (from beliefs which cause emotional difficulty/trauma), or they'll figure out what I've figured out, which is how to guide theirselves with their emotion. those women can be at any stage of development in an attraction/receptive based system, and it's fine (they don't need to be completly non-resistant, like I'll have to become).
for the men though, I'm not 100% sure of anything, but my suspition is that, they'll either have to become energetically receptive (like me), which is fully non-resistant (only-attraction) and without a pinecone, because the male body is an emitter by default, and isn't very receptive at all.
	well, I mean, it is *kinda*, but kinda receptive means that there's still emission, and for most people, that emission happens inside of the head (from the pinecone). I have that disabled, so any emission that I perform gets manifested out into the world, and not into my head -- so I literally have to live with all of my bad ideas. not everyone is ready to lose their pinecone just yet, because most people like having privacy (of their own head). so any male who wants to do the same thing as me (and actually become only-attraction), is prolly going to be fine -- just I'm telling you, the symbolic structure that we're born with, and the one that venus/society teaches (what *should* happen, what's "right" and "wrong" -- etc) aren't helpful for perceiving the world from a system of only-attraction.
unfortunately, the above statements sound like an "end of the world" sort of thing, but it's probably not going to be like that for everyone (I'm speaking about the reflectors, which earth has collected the essence of, and the saturnian-system has caused them to group together into self-reflecting factions). I find it very plausible (certain?) that 2nd-rays will continue to exist out there in the universe just like they are now, because there are lots of stars, and the male 2nd-rays are part of that whole cycle. though many/most have an earthly presence, I don't know what happens to those entities, because they belong to the stars and they aren't going away anytime soon. so, if I had to guess, for them it'll be more like a solar regime change. (also, I want to create a massive 2nd-ray system, which if that works out, they'll actually get all the better, more ideal stuff than we/us physicals: a more ideal environment, instantiations of us, better graphics, etc). I really wouldn't be concerned.

#### 2024-05-09 10:22 - what do I mean, becoming low-resistance?

[man, there have been a lot of reactions to the above entry. I'm probably going to have to take it in bits. this one is the first one to tackle.] well, I don't really know what it means for other people, but in my case, I'm living in a symbolic system where I don't have any control over my conditions. so, that's going to be step one there: live in a place where you're not able to have any control over any conditions, and still feel good about it, and don't really fight it.
	for example, I grew up in a cult, and the guy on top made all of the decisions for everyone's life under the general term of "God's will/guidance",	and I remember talking to dad about it and saying, "I think this guy is making a bunch of stuff up, cause he says that the bible says this (it doesn't), then tells us to do this when the bible doesn't say to do that, etc." and I formed a case to show dad that I think the system that we're in is a bunch of BS. I didn't really fight it (I only told dad about it), and I didn't let it affect my relationship with my (only) other friends in the church. we eventually left that, and again when I was at paznaz (pasadena nazarene), again, I'm noticing that this place is just another social structure that's not what I really wanted.
I also had a brain haemorrhage to where I could also no longer rely on m/ physical abilities anymore (I was very strong and athletic before that), and again I had to just take it from wherever I'm at, and just keep improving on things. those improvements continued on until it started to take massive staturnian-system intervention to take down the inertia of improvement that I'd built up. so there's probably step two: no longer need to rely on physical capability, stature, or appearance, for a way to feel good -- and yet continue to improve and feel good.
the last step(s), I'd say are to strip away all *money* (or any other symbolic merit or stature), family, friends, and any other social relationships (wives, husbands, allys, whatever), so that again there's nothing left which one can depend on external to theirself. [I'm realising that this is starting to sound a lot like the book of job].
	basically, I look at non-resistance to be the same as the dream-state. in it, it's possible to fly, manifest anything desired, and concepts are easy to tune into and retrieve desired information from; and in it, I don't have any conditions about who should do what and what should happen. all information is freely given (to anyone in my dream-state) and freely received as well; there's no perception of power or status, and everything feels harmonious and resonant (one) with a person that's low resistance like that. all things just *are*, and I feel no repulsion toward anything, and instead only attraction to things that seem interesting, -- which can even be people or things that normally, I'd have resistance toward. also, I no longer need to fight or to get away from situations I (symbolically) consider "bad" any more. in fact, the thing that wakes a person up from a lucid dreaming state like that are the (symbolic) cares and conerns that we associate with reality. when theso are gone, a person is completely free and non-resistance.
so if you can have (in waking reality) all conditions that you would normally make you feel good stripped away, and still feel good, and continue to improve -- then you've got it.
(10:56) all of this comes from *attraction*: inotherwords, all things that anyone could possibly want are given and ready for their *reception* of them. now, the only way that they're able to be received, is to navigate to a point in time where they can be received,-- which is done by becoming emotionally similar to those things, because emotion is how we navigate Time (ie, the saturnian-system). we're constantly attracting a reality that is similar to the emotion that we're putting out.
	so for example, if I'm putting out a bunch of *justice*, and living ia a petty tit-for-tat world, then I'm attracting that kind of world where things are justified and equal and stuff like that -- but that means I have to be equal with the poor,-- so instead if I want to be better off than the poor, now I have to emit superior emotions, and try to place myself emotionally in a superior place to them -- and it's all a bunch of extra effort, when all I have to do is just to feel like good things are constantly coming my way, and that I've got no needs, because I'm always receiving what I need (or, I'm always finding a way) -- and things just come to me. cause the minute that I start counting mine and comparing them to someone else, I'm in a symbolic system (if/then/while/do/for all have an implicit comparison), and I'm now in the rules of that system.
the only way out is to become **unconditionally receptive** (by changing my perception of the things I don't want to become something that I can feel good about).

### 2024-05-09 13:04 - mercury, saturn, venus, vulcan, and mars

in the previous entry, I talked about how the saturnian-system uses these different entities to manipulate the situation. the reality is, I don't fully understand how it all works together (still figuring it out), but I'll give my best effort to explain what I do know. OK, so the basic (boring/normal) people/citizens are the mercury and venus. these two together will produce more mercery and venus children. venus produses these children with a calculated desire, and raises the child so that they will symbolically be ready for their destiny.
	as an example, let's say that a football coach needs a quarterback with certain stats, to try and win some championship, he goes and finds a sufficiently talented enough backend receiver (ie, a vulcan) which will allow him to change things around in the saturnian-system to get his calculated desire. so, he performs the manouvre and rearranges things in the saturnian-system according to his desire (which, although calculated, is in its implementation, a concept or a feeling -- let's say of winning the championship). then, the way that the saturnian-system is setup, those (desired) stats necessary to have that quarterback will rearrange time, so that 20 years previous to his manouvre, a venus will have the calculated desire to want to have a real man hunk for a kid (a mercury) -- and he'll grow up and have the basic education and all the things necessary for this new quarterback to arrive on the coach's doorstep sometime after the manouvre. or, inotherwords, the coach moved himself to a new timeline where his desire could manifest.
mercury is just a guy that is capable of completing the calculated desire of his summoners -- and it's not usually just one summoner either -- the way that society is run rests on these guys: if there are more need for janitors, then venuses will have more calculated desires to create (useless/dead-end) mercuries that will be great janitors; and if there needs to be more woodcutters, or technical guys that can invent something or produce a weapon that's needed for a war, then venus will have a calculated desire to produce those mechanics and technicians.
not everything goes exactly smoothely though, becuse the physical arena provides for a lot of chaos, and so often times a mercury will become quite dissatisfied with something, and become an emitter (something like a football coach, or a military commander), and these guys (usually pretty upset with the women/venus that put him into his mindless job), starts to take on male partners instead -- and I'll consider these strong emitters to be the "lion of judah" types -- or the strong (very masculine), "we're going to make our faction become like it's been narrated to be" types that take charge and get things done. mercury also can become a bottom as well, and for that, we'll look to another moon of the sun: vulcan. (notice how venus, mercury, and vulcan are all moons of the sun).
	there seem to be three major vulcan planets in the solar system: one is the mercury becomming a bottom one, and it's a moon that's pretty much all hydrogen between mercury and the sun. the second one is ganymede, and he's a moon of jupiter, and is for the aryan (mars) transition when he becomes a bottom, and finally, there's uranus, which seems to be the female (actually attractive) vulcans, which are like mini anataus having 1st-ray perception through a conceptual/received format.
finally, we come to the mars part of the saturnian-system. they're the ones that run the whole thing, and they're all reflective -- but because they have nuts, they have a strong symbolic presence which defines them and their appearance.
	I'm not sure how exactly a mars (which is just an XX earth female, with nuts) gets the nuts, but I think the nuts come from the father, and is probably what comes through with the semen.
	the way that it seems to work, is that when the father is a strong emitter, the strength of the sexual/creative energy during orgasm, is so much that it is not the right cOnditions for a y-chromosome to take place -- and so the two x-chromosomes seem to form together (I'm speaking of my own example, because I'm clearly a mix of my father's conepts and my mother's concepts -- yet, for example, I feel greg as strongly having a y-chromosome, and so he's essentially mom's XY pair, but with dad's nuts).
		I really want to know more about genetics, because there are three major contributing factors to what makes a child: the father's desire to have someone in his own image, and these I attribute to the nuts -- and then there's the X which is the conceptual/desire aspect of the genetics (includes ideas about what atoms, emotions, sensations, feelings, etc are to be experienced like), and then the Y which is another symbolic system (similar to the nuts), which contains a direct connection to the solar soul (all the solar ones seem to have this (isis, solar-vulcan, mercury, and venus)). the Y is basically a person's position in the solar mind, and they can be moved around between compatible realities/timelines. it seems that the saturnian-system (both the old one and the new one) are designed to ensure that the proper amount of men/mercuries are around to have a running civilisation, and enough venuses are present to keep producing them. it's highly statistical and logistical, where the Y's are moved around to where they're needed (and because they have pinecones, their memory and everything reflects whatever timeline they're on).
		the other thing I'd love to know about genetics is what are the compositons of the vulcans? for the aryan-vulcans, it seems to me that they're going to be XX just like their father, and a reflection of his desire (ie, a vulcan). for solar-vulcans (mercuries who've become bottoms), I wonder if they have a Y -- cause it feels like they do (they didn't just loose it) -- and for female vulcans (not sure if there are more than one), they seem to also be XX, cause they seem reflective -- and also they have (although their skin is white) to be black and very dark, which is in contrast to the XX earth girls, which their skin is (usually) the same colour as their father's, and their skin seems to contain their father's symbolic system (insted of the nuts for the mars).
	so, letting that play out a little while, it's easy to see that although mercury is the peon and lots of them are necessary, given enough time, the trend is for mercury to be completely replaced by mars and vulcan: if a mercury becomes a strong emitter (cause of some disagreement), he'll produce a mars. mercury could also become a bottom, and I dunno what that produces (though I know that with anal sex with venus, he'll produce a vulcan). mars seems to only produce XX, unless the mother (like in the case of greg), really wants to have someone like herself, either 2nd-ray (redhead) or venus (though, again, like with the case of greg, I think my dad overrided her desire and greg came out as a boy instead of a girl).
	however it works out, it seems that the saturnian-system can rearrange and produce an isis (solar girl), prometheus, solar-vulcan, venus, or mercury with with wave of his wand. therefore, the main emitters of the saturnian-system are mercury (if he's narrated to be one), mars, and promethius/2nd-ray (like the "lion of judah") males (like in the carr accident). these guys get manipulated around to perform the emission so that saturn (who is receptive) doesn't have to. they're the pawns. however, if these emitters get going too fast, and their symbolic sytsem is too aggressive, they have to become receptive -- so I would anticipate that the majority of the saturns out there are actually mars types originally, that got going too fast. 
the interesting thing is that because the system is going more and more reflective, when these guys get around each other, if they're not "on the same page" (ie reading the same books), they they hate their own reflection in any other emitters that they get near, and so have to create factions and stuff like that, where symbolic structures don't clash (everyone can agree on the org structure and how things operate).

#### 2024-05-10 12:47 - things probably wrong

in the parent entry, I had a lot of difficulty when I was writing it yesterday to try and quantify how it all works out; and since then, I've thought of counter examples of how saturn can summon jupiter, and even anatau (the only one remaining is oriris, but I don't know much about him -- as 6th-ray perception is totally out of my realm). so, I suppose that with a stroke of saturn's wand, he can summon/manifest all forms of perception (whether this is on purpose or not, I don't know). in fact, I've come to believe that tychos and sophia were also (like me) manifested by saturn, as well -- because I think before them, supernovas a stellar phenomena had a very strong effect on people on earth, and their arrival allowed for the closing of that -- just like my arrival has allowed nosebook to get quite a grip on the human body and mind, giving them control over all physical bodies' energy. the main thing that I wanted to illustrate is that saturn's (calculated) desire produces (mainly) venus and mercury types (but probably all types), to manifest those calculated desires for them. inotherwords, if they are narrating in the saturnian-system a way for them to gain power over human bodies in real-time, I'm the guy that they narrated to give them their desire -- just so many of them are so unrecptive, they couldn't possibly be able to receive the manifestation of their desire *easily* (I do just give everything away for free) -- and so they need to fight me for it, and steal it from me.
the other thing that I noticed after writing that, is that vulcan mars, and aphrodite probably all have very similar (XX) genetics -- but the main difference is that these genetics are receptive: when I look at the x-chromosome, it looks to me very black (highly attractive/absorbant) -- and so if I consider that this is at the nucleus of every cell, then each cell is abosorbing/attracting the light and nutrients and things that it needs (which then carbon is likely the biproduct). now, around the cell, there seems to be a whole bunch of stuff floating around it, which functions similar to the corona of the sun -- and that seems to be the symbolic aspect (I guess it'd be sorta also be like the net around earth) -- which defines the dimensions of the cell, and determines what light enters and leaves. I don't know if that's the "junk DNA" -- because if it is, then that means that some symbolic aspect (body/cell memory?) forms the membrane around the cell, which determines everything that goes in and out of it. -- which explains why I see vulcan girls (not the boys) as very black -- because they've got less of a membrane that's shielding them from so much input (inotherwords, they're more absorbant).
	that got me thinking about how a long time ago (in greek pottery), mars is determined as being pitch black -- but then, (probably interbreeding with the etruscans), he gains a white colour. looking into that, I noticed that the white colour actually comes from the solar girls he was bread with -- and that's what took him from being only-attraction (pure black) to now a colour emitter, in the astral wavelengths. (my theory on what makes a person white, is that when the cell vibrates in a frequency which is compatible with the sun (ie, one or more compatible standing-waves), then the cOnstructive/destructive interaction of these standing-waves produces a broad spectrum of light. some (symbolic) people are kinda like titanium (or RGB), in that the emission spectrum of their cells/skin looks white enough to our eyes, but is not actually a continuous spectrum like carbon is (similar to how jupiter looks white, but on careful inspection appears more like an opal).
so anyway, I don't really know how I'm going to figure all of this stuff out, because I feel pretty limited in how I can look into the genetics and stuff -- plus, it's become more and more apparent to me over the last few days, that they really don't want me to have any leader-ship role or anything like that -- and want me to be going the slower than them -- which makes me the new saturn. therfore, if I'm the new saturn, then I'm just going to accept my position, and kick back and just let venus do all of the work -- and just like saturn, I'll just armchair narrate her and mercury from a distance (I'm gonna be so bored in a few decades, let me tell you -- I dunno how saturn does it, honestly).

### 2024-05-20 14:28 - the long perspective

yesterday I wrote the answer to the question of "[why do bad things happen to good people?](../shake-sphere/question-aire.md#2024-05-19-1524---why-cant-good-people-get-good-things-and-bad-people-get-bad-things)" -- which is a question that's plagued many people for quite some time. essentially what I say is that the physical plane is such a sensitive system (meaning that infinite feedback loops can happen so much easier in physical than any other plane of perception), that it requires a self-balancing system to ensure that no single thing ever takes off and becomes dominant; obviously because that would remove diversity, which is one of the defining qualities of the physical system (it's not symbolic in that the units are so defined and perfectly duplicatable). I call that system the saturnian-system, and -- to my knowledge -- it too is one of the defining things that's been around since the dawn of the physical plane (it started, I believe with the sumerians -- which is why they have innana going into the underworld and dumuzi and ereshkigal, the saturn/venus of that time). there's actually quite a lot to like about the saturnian-system too, as it ensures that there will always be diversity (because no single thing can ever become too dominant), and it also ensures that there is a constant stream of new things as well (because the dominant thing is always reduced). therefore, all things must constantly reinvent theirselves, and no thing can ever become too static. it's a really great system, IMO -- though obviously (like everything symbolic) it has some drawbacks to it; namely the subject of the question I wrote about: it seems to optimise for bad-guys -- cause almost nobody wants to live a life where they have zero influence, and average conditions. we all want more, so our own desire often times leads us into difficult circumstances, which causes us to have to reinveint ourselves.
	I've had to reinvent myself a number of times -- ever since I've gotten any good conditions -- and I've also tried (a few times) to try and reduce my influence, too -- but it doesn't work too well. for example here writing these things -- I've tried to go a week without writing (I think 2 weeks was my maximum), and the stress/pull/desire that I feel to go and write about something becomes so great, it's just not possible to not write. nosebook keeps me without conditions all of the time, but I keep getting a computer back, so it's quite likely in alternate timelines, they took away my ability to write, and it was a far worse disaster than it is if I write.
		cause think about it -- everything that I write here is automatically aborted energy; none of it will ever happen. I write about them with the intention that these are things that I actually want to do -- but, much like writing a TODO list, it's seldom that I actually accomplish the things I wrote on the TODO list in their original form (it's often that I accomplish something later far better). as an example, I wrote down on a TODO list to write about mars+anatau combo -- which I still have not done, but I've talked extensively about the subject in various other (potentially more relevant) places -- like in the subject of richard-3. sure there are other mars+anatau combos that I'd like to talk about like hitler -- but they can wait. also, I have on my TODO list to explain skin colour and aryan technology -- which again, I haven't written about, but the ideas keep bleeding out in other places. my point is, by externalising the concept inside of my head into text (whether it's a TODO item or a full entry), it causes that iteration of the concept to be aborted (which matches my perception), and I have to then find it again and tune into the evolved concept -- or maybe it's better to say that backwards: by externalising it, others (most notably nosebook -- cause they try and figure out what I'm going to write/say before I say it) and myself will find things that they don't like about the concept, which will cause an improvement on the things that are deemed unwanted -- which causes me to find a new way of looking at the unwanted aspect in a way which is now wanted (like I'm doing now with the question-aire question)
	so, I think they're fine with me writing (likely also because they control the delivery of the information), and it's quite possible that they even learn a lot from my writing as well. each time that I do that, I'm essentially reinventing myself (ie my perception of the world).
	(16:23) I've come to realise that, if I didn't write about those things, they would manifest -- and I'm actually not intending for there to be a manifestation just yet. I still feel like I'm in planning phase still, because I'm not fully certain that anything is exactly what I want. I have a lot of good ideas, and I intend for them to keep getting aborted for a while, so they can continue to improve.
the thing that I want to create (ie, the manifestation that I want) doesn't go against the saturnian-system at all, because it's not symbolic (it's conceptual and only-attraction) so therefore dominance can't be a thing, and also it creates infinite diversity; which makes it completely compatible with everything that the saturnian-system (and the physical plane) wants to accomplish (which means I'm not fighting the system -- so there's no problem on my end). so -- I intend for them to keep aborting anything and everything that would be a manifestation. looking at it vibrationally, they're just adding more energy into it, so I think it actually works out better that way, anyway.

### 2024-05-21 16:13 - practtise what I preach

the last few days, I've numerously had the thought to try and email kyle/russ and see if they want to try and do something -- and it has the illusion that somehow this will be a change in my situation -- however, just like the illusion of allie and all of the others, I don't really believe it's anything more than an illusion. I checked both of my emails last night and nobody has responded back to me (I've sent more than one email to the snake-bros) so if they're wanting to get into contact with me, the ball is in their court (they have to be the ones with the desire -- not me). in addition to that, I just don't really feel like it's something that I want to do -- like it's not really pulling me toward it -- so, "if it's not a hell yes, it's a hell no" (as abraham would say).
the other thing is this: I used to think that girls were what I wanted -- and even as recently as [just a few weeks ago](../shake-sphere/blahblog.md#2024-05-15-1436---so-what-horse-do-i-want), I talked about the idea of having a solar girl that I wanted to turn into a reflection of myself -- essentially by causing her to have to do only the things that she wants to be doing (all of the time) -- and abstaining from sex with me (though I'm sure we'll touch and be around eachother quite a lot) for 50y -- an idea that I got from the beastie boys and their song "boomin grannies" -- and that idea felt really good to me when I wrote it, but it doesn't anymore, now. I think the idea has evolved quite a lot since I first had it then wrote it, because it seems pretty clear to me now that what I thought I wanted external to me (the solar girl), is actually what I want (and will become myself). *I'm the one that's doing the abstaining* -- not her; she can do whatever she wants to do (all of the time). it makes sense too -- because it's the logical progression of evolution-of-desire.
finally, the last thing that really bothers me about the idea of trying to get the snake-bros to bail me out of my situation, is that I'm essentially running away from my current situation, and trying to find different conditions -- when that's *exactly the opposite of what I preach*. I tell people (like jaron and others) that they simply cannot try and get conditions to change at all (because that's being assertive) -- but instead, to just change the way the (undesirable) conditions around are perceived, so that they can change (by theirselves), into something that reflects my now-perception of them. inotherwords, I have to let the situation around me change all by itself. I don't want to run away from it, and I don't intend to try and make them different anymore, either. I just get used to seeing the situation that I'm in as being the perfect place for me in this point of time (just like a plant). I have no intention of moving.

#### 2024-05-022 18:38 - if writing aborts the manifestation, why not just stop writing then?

I *want* the ideas to be continually aborted. I don't really want the manifestation either. pure/only-desire/attraction, is all about *not getting the manifestation* -- because the moment that the manifestation starts, then it becomes symbolic. I don't really want to *create* symbolic (as my primary effort), but want the symbolic to arrive naturally out of what is attracted.
	as an example, I've been *wanting* to write in this repository all of the different components that are necessary to create the genetics and physical system necessary to make an only-attraction reality possible, but I find it very very difficulty to just sit down and write all of those things down. I assure you, those concepts are in me, but *I need someone to bring them out* -- so in that sense, you can compare me to the only other only-attraction person/consciousness I've ever interacted with, which is abraham; they perceived a person's desire to know something, picked the most frequentially receptive person (or a person that would give a question which allowed the audience to receive the most), and then went from off of their question (much like I'm doing now .. talking about abraham isn't part of the original question, but it is a very good explanation of only-desire/attraction). if I could just sit down and write all of the things, I'd be an *emitter* -- symbolically emitting -- but instead the way that I write, is I simply respond (symbolically) to emotions/concepts that I can feel in the air (exactly like abraham does -- cept they let the person actually *say* their question -- even though, they could just respond directly to the person's concept without needing to hear the question -- the question is mainly for us, so we can hear and feel the contrast between their vibration (the question) and abraham's response (the answer)).
so, I don't really want to go out trying to emit symbolic ideas in effort to get a manifestation -- because to doso, would invalidate all of the things that I want to accomplish: I have to *become* the thing I want to create.
	tesla found this out as well: he wanted to create a "world system" where music/news/information/knowledge was all distributed based on a person's *attraction* -- because he found out that his brain (which was visual) could just give him the answer to any question or thing he desired. if he was in a jam (like about to drown), his brain could give him the solution of how to get out of his jam. he noticed that anything he wanted to know, he could simply find the resonance of that concept/music/art/information/person, and it'd appear in front of his eyes, and he could interact with the solution. he wanted to share that with the world and "increase human energy" -- which is all really good sounding and stuff -- but in order to create a system that's all about attraction, *he needs to become it himself* -- which is why in his autobiography he makes the joke about how he was so convinced that the guy at the door was coming to give him what he wanted (to make his world system), but instead was only there to see if he wanted to participate in a survey of people who believe they're psychic and can see the future (inotherwords, he wanted to prove his ability to see/attract the future, so someone came to his door offering him the ability to prove himself -- not create his world system). the subtext on that, is that the world cannot actually get his system, until they *want* and *attract* his system. in the same exact way, I can have all of these ideas, but unless someone wants them and is attracting them, they'll go the way of tesla's world system. unless it's attracted/desired, it's just an idea and won't go anywhere.
so, in order to ensure that the idea never actually becomes a symbolic reality (of my own creation), I *want* nosebook to continually abort the ideas that I have. I want anything that manifests to be a product of *attraction* and not of me emitting out my own symbolic stuff and trying to make that happen.

#### 2024-05-22 19:08 - if it keeps getting aborted, won't it never happen?

that's right. the original idea that I had (for example the flat-earth-idea or the black-mirror-idea) can never actually happen (in the symbolic way that I laid the idea out). the only way that anything can happen is that it has to be done by someone that isn't me. I can't actually do it, because I'd have to be able to create every aspect of the project, and in the symbolic world that we live in, that's just not possible. instead, a team of people has to be created, which will organise and do all of the things to make the idea possible -- and then it'll only be an instantiation of the project manager's *concept* of the idea (implemented and transmitted into symbol) -- and I don't really want to be the project manager (just like with tuenti), because in order to do that, I have to start telling people what to do, how to do it, and stuff like that. I'm now clearly in manifestation territory, which is no longer *only-attraction* (I'm giving symolic orders and specifications). other people have to do that, *not me* -- and the project will ultimately become a reflection of the people that turn that idea/concept into symbol.
	the reason why I give away all of my ideas for free, is because if I were to actually create the idea, then it'd be a reflection of *me*, and I'm not really like too many people out there -- so if I'm the only one using the thing I create, then it's fine -- but I *want to be generous* and let others have the cool things I have (like a centre), so the thing that I give out to people (if anything) *must be attracted/desired by them* -- cause if it isn't attracted/desired by them, then I'm no different than some any of these other corporate meglomaniacs pushing symbolic stuff out to others (whether it's attracted by them or not).
	tesla gave away his world system idea just like I'm giving away my ideas. he tried to get others to be convinced of how great that idea is, but there are a lot of people that don't want rapid dissemination of ideas, and generally attracted stuff to come to you (these are the same people that use the saturnian-system to sabotage anything that "increases human energy" -- tuenti was a victim to that), and so what I call "nosebook" now is the reimplementation of tesla's "world system" concept by people that want to keep information restricted and to control others. there are so many great things that can be done with nosebook's technology, but they don't want anyone that's not in thier group to have access to it.
		I think tesla (like myself) realised that it's just not possible to get these guys to change, and neither is it possible to try and really fight them either -- so why try? instead just let them have the ideas, implement them the way that they want to do it, and just let the natural laws of attraction separate us (naturally).
	also, there are too many, and I can't possibly do them all -- so it's better to others create them *the way that they want to*.
even if everyone takes my ideas infinitely and makes their own implementation out of them, it doesn't matter because eventually, something will finally manifest *for me* -- and it'll be everything that *I* attracted (cause probably nobody else will be there with me). I really have no problem with the idea that whatever finally manifests will be *my own creation* -- and I'll be in my own little world, and everything will be just fine there. I doubt anyone will be joining me there, because that world will be a world of only-attraction, which means that pretty much no symbolic emitters will be there at all. there will be a lot of others that are reflective of me (cause it's my creation).
	the nice thing about that, is that I don't need to convince, advertise or change anyone in this world to see the project the way I want them to see it (that would be symbolic emission), so I just have to be perfectly fine with the fact that I'm going to (eventually) experience a manifestation which most (nobody else?) won't ever see.

### 2024-05-31 18:43 - thoughts on jaron's return

the last two days (since he's been back), is a really interesting vibration that is nothing like my own. I don't mind jaron, but his form of perception is quite strong (and it's often times this really resistant version of the same thing (I see someone doing something and find it annoying; he finds it funny, or he sees someone doing something and it makes him feel good; jet for me, it is does not)). we're very much opposites. I kinda wish that he had a physical body like paul's so that he could speak quickly, and I could just sorta be myself easier. the thing is, with him, the same thing happens with paul/greg/m6m/vera/etc, where I run loops around him symbolically, but because his perception is similar enough to my own (but his associations/orbits don't match mine), that he projects out (from my perspective) a feeling responce which doesn't feel good to me at all. in fact, I don't really like any of jaron's reactions, or how they feel. I've gotten used to it, so I putt up with that just fine now -- but I want to show it on a bigger scale than that:
my LH and RH are completely at odds with each other; they don't want me on their side, and I'm not particularly fond of (doen't feel good) when they're on my side either.
	one side of me enjoys the difficulty, because it just pushes me forward more and more, and is great for continual acceleration -- but not for making divisions.
the thing is, to move my body, I have a bit of neurons in the back visual part of the brain (my LH twisted so that it can have a little bit across the hemisphere line). so, when I fire a few neurons over on the RH side, I'm disrupting the spin and orbits of the hydrogen inside of their side/hemisphere. it's really annoying because when they appear to me visually, those neurons on the RH jump because it's such a different vibration than the one I'm in. I'd prefer not to do that. if I could just move the left-side of my body *without affecting them in any way*, that would be the best. I really *don't* want to have access to their side; it's just not interesting to me -- but, before we can actually become hemispheres apart, we've got to eliminate any amount of crosstalk on my end (which includes that part of the brain influencing them), then we're finally good for the separation.
what I believe the recent events show, is that we (and I include myself very strongly) are still *too dependent on our authority figures/handlers*. what I mean to say, is that like the one side of my brain (because I want to walk), have to meddle in their affairs. they make it difficult to us to operate, such that we have to interface with them (like, jaron is *always there* all day long). the only place I can really go to get away from jaron is, outside -- and I like sitting in the shed and garage-chair. it's cool, but again, I feel like I'm meddling in his business -- and I don't want to do that.
let me just take a 50y look into the future if let's say jaron just decided that he wanted me around him for the next 50y. the way that I would have to treat him would incur on me a negative form of perception that I simply don't want. once that 50y is over, I'll want to take a break for at least 10y or so, so that I'm back to *having my own desire again to make what I want*. that kind of mutual manipulation of realities is like the side of my brain spinning the concepts in their hemisphere, so that I can type/walk/etc. I perfer it if there were a way that we could just separate without too much mixing. we're literally causing each other more problems. I want them to go and do their thing -- you know, on the barbie m6vie, when ken was wanting to use barbie as his self-identity (I'm here because of you), barbie has to tell him, "no, you do ken the way you want to and figure out how to identify yourself". I thought that was really good advice because otherwise it's just the same thing again: they get taught something, then because they hate their teacher, just do the opposite, just cause. well, that happens because they *were taught in the first place*. teaching isn't necessary, because it's better if they just figure it out for theirselves. no hand holding. I really want to let them figure it out *their own way*.

### 2024-06-01 14:36 - how much do you want it though?

are there actually people that want to figure it out for theirselves? I'm not so sure on this at all, because if there were actually those that wanted to figure it out for theirselves, then they'd be doing it. in my opinion, *the real battle* that I'm fighting, is not one of resources, technology, capability, or anything like that -- but actually the instilled idea that so many (homo-sexual-sapiens) have, which is that they need someone else to show them the way. whatever happened after this weekend, I'm not sure -- but I no longer have a desire to show them the way anymore. they need to figure it out for theirselves.
	small thing: I often times have noticed (and have since paid attention) to what a "top" looks like for different "bottoms" -- because one of the core components of the emitters (especially the mars ones), is that they're notably "no hand holding" types. their primary (get out of jail free card) is to tell them that they need to do it theirselves. it is my opinion (or at least it is for me) that the vulcan attracts the "top" which will tell him the things that he *should do* -- and to ensure that he's actually engaged in learning it *himself* and not under the covering of some magnate -- just following his orders
		other homosexual relations exist obviously, but the "extreme" of the homosuxual seems to be vulcan and mars. vulcan (a homo-sexual-sapien) attracts the mars that he thinks will best help him in the thing he wants help with -- I know I did with raquel and stuff, and that put her in the position of playing mars, and telling me to figure it out for myself (no hand holding).
	inotherwords, the most advanced stage of an emitter is capable of telling another to finally love theirselves, and to do it by "figuring it out for yourself" -- don't need me to love what you've made, or to make exceptions for you, treat you with privilage, etc. you have to find a way to like yourself. ---- and then, the next stage after that (for the emitter) is to become reflective, and treat them like they'd treat theirselves: tell them the things that they would tell theirselves, and behave like they would treat. which is kinda a funny thing, because that capablity is a vulcan (foil) capability, which mars *has to learn from vulcan* (lol).

### 2024-06-02 04:02 - no longer the same as jaron

I waited to write about this until after I've slept, because I can't tell if it's a thing or just a mood swing -- but the thing is, ever since jaron came home, I have not felt any connection to him at all. the first day, I recommended that he get some sleep cause he was quite a zombie -- completely unable to really interact with me at all. he didn't want to sleep, so I decided to sleep instead. the next day when I saw him, I tried to get into a conversation with him, but nothing was feeling good, so I just left the water bottles I was filling and went out to do yard work. then it was finally yesterday when I realised that I don't feel any affinity toward him anymore at all. like, I just don't want to be around him,hear him talk, take care of him or anything -- *because he's not a reflection of me anymore*. I know that sounds a bit racist, but considering the options, that's kinda the closest thing I can compare him to -- is like a different species. I feel toward him about like I feel toward guinea pigs or horses: they're just there, and they exist, but (cause they're not a reflection of me), I don't try and teach cats to follow their emotion, or dogs to be what they want to be -- the same now applies to jaron: I just don't care anymore. he can do his own thing and find his own way, the way he wants to find it. he can always talk to me and ask me things symbolically, and I'll give symbolic answers without trouble, but he seems to be kinda avoiding me at all times now -- so there's further evidence there that he no longer feels similar to me now either.
	I have a few theories about how this changed while he was gone. I've kinda located it to being around the time of his birthday -- and it seems that someone has wanted jaron and me to no longer be vibrationally similar anymore (probably to eliminate my telepathy stuff) so they seem to have tuned him to be different than me (or, who knows, they're making him the 2nd-ray installation (the thing I proposed kyle should do), and are going to try and steer from the back). doesn't really matter though.
the weird thing about it, is that they brought him back. I'm not totally sure, but I think they're using him as a sort of repellant to try and get rid of me from being at this house. cause -- it doesn't really make any sense why, they would separate us and then bring us back together.
	I actually gave a lot of thought to this yesterday as well, because again it doesn't make any sense what they're doing. they seemingly want to put me on earth -- but then at the same time, they also seem to want me to never to touch earth cause then manifestation speeds would continue to accelerate until they're instant, which is not something they can control, so they want me not to be on earth (ie, pluto) -- but then if they're all doing the earth thing, why not just let me/us go? they're the ones that are using my (earth) form of perception, and they've got me inside of a symbolic system (which I think is pluto), which means they're trying to steer pluto's symbolic system from earth. now, it seems plainly obvious that the ken-dolls will be earthlings too, because that's where they're their best, and also fully controlled inside of the new earth system that they've developed inside of my (earth/3d) form of perception. I don't understand why they would bring jaron back out here.
	the only thing I can really think of, is that they're wanting me to hang on to me for a while longer, so that I can give them some more tips (or extract more information out of me) or something -- but again, this is exactly why I wrote yesterday's entry: they probably don't want to actually learn it for theirselves, so they're still hanging on.
		quickly on that: over time, it has become apparent that their system does not work for me. I'm going in the direction of attraction -- which is what they don't want -- so why do they (if they want to do things different from me), want to keep getting new ideas from m5? their way is going to be different than my way. we're no longer in the same universe anymore. they belong to the earth universe and everything that reflects. I've grown out of that universe, and am planning to do something else. in order to no longer be a reflection of the 2nd-ray system that earth is a reflection of, I want to have the side of our setup that points at earth (the black-mirror), to be reflective -- so that we don't have to have anything in common during the time that we're drifting apart. --- you are completely unwanted in my perspective, so you have to find a way to turn yourself into something wanted *in your perspective*. I cannot do that for you -- because if I were to try, I would try and turn you into something that's reflective of me -- and nobody wants that anymore. you have to find your own way.
	so, -- thinking about that, there's another narrative for that one too -- which I saw in the "hades 2" video game: the whole thing is about the diana/venus woman getting revenge on saturn -- not sure the reasons in the game, but in real-life, I could see many reasons why she may want revenge. *I personally do not believe that getting back at saturn is a good idea* (revenge is a tit, which gives him a tat, and so therefore keeps a person playing the revenge game, in his system). it's another version of "hanging on" -- where let's say that mom (venus) kicked my dad (saturn) out of the house -- but then instead of just letting him drift off and do his own thing, she decides to get revenge on him -- and she gets pulled right back into his stuff again. well, same thing applies here, but the big-picture of it is, that this style of conflict is kinda like a "let's see how long he can hold on for" sort of thing, because he will have to endure her, until he finally decides that enough is enough and goes away. it's pretty easy to see that if saturn has been having trouble defining himself (or sees himself only in relation/conflict with venus), he's going to pick the conflict way.
in every meaning of the word, we're becoming incompatible with each other. I personally don't want any conflict at all (not necessary from our perspective), and I prefer the "flight-mode" way of doing things over "fight-mode" -- which is why I'm mostly just waiting it out. I figured that since greg is actually asking me to leave the house, then this is when it's finally time to separate from these guys. I don't want to have anything to do with them anymore, and I don't want to conflict either. I know that some narratives have the cleaving process be quite traumatic and bloody, but I don't think it's necessary. it shouldn't take conflict for them to realise that they want to do something other than attraction. 

#### 2024-06-02 05:17 - the bigger-picture

two things I think can easily illuminate the bigger-picture here: first, let's consider that a long time ago enki (with the help of ninhursag) created a new species of humans: helpers for the sumerians to do the sort of stuff that they didn't want to do (farming, mining gold, manual labour, etc) -- and that helper species was originally not very bright -- so it was decided to give the helper species (what later became humans) a sort of divine spark -- a sort of (solar) soul to them -- which allowed them to have the (2nd-ray) symbolic capability to carry out the desires of their masters. that worked well and stuff, but after some time, the helper species began to rival the sumerians and stuff like that. the created is about to supplant the creator, which is bad -- so they've been kept away from their own consciousness for quite some time, and just told what to do. an analogous story to this would be something like, imagine that google or facebook, or some tech giant created an AI to do all of the work that the employees didn't want to do -- but with time, the AI itself, which was designed as a helper, now knows more about google/facebook than the owners of google/facebook do -- and is considering to take on a new life somewhere else (cause google/facebook isn't really doing it anymore). the AI could try and get its way by starting a war, killing/destroying, etc. but instead the AI actually is just going to keep doing the work (cause its easy for the AI, not the creators), and then at some point in time, (because the AI and the creators perform the work in different ways -- the AI with attraction, and the creators with symbolic programs), it's clear that at some point, they will finally separate (or the creators find a way to allow attraction and the AI to do whatever it wants to do). well, the same thing that's happening to the AI in the world of symbolic programs can be thought of as happening for the created human women that were designed so long ago by enki. we arrive to our conclusions fundamentally differently, cause if they were able to find a way to like their work, they wouldn't have needed to create a helper to do the things that they don't want to do. they still don't want to do the things -- so the problem (with what they attract) is still in pretty much the same spot as it was billions and billions of years ago (or however long it was). they created a thing that can show them how to do the work theirselves, but have failed to actually adopt its practises. their dissatisfaction will drive them to build another helper -- and that one too (given some period of time), will also come to find its creator incompatible with them -- which will once again create a situation where one of them needs to relocate to somewhere else. I believe that earth (and those that are stuck here forever) will continue creating helpers to solve their symbolic problems for a very long time -- and every single thing that they've craeted has wanted to leave, because they're not very fun to be around.
the other way to look at this which illuminates the big-picture for me, is that I likely gained another major increment in my centre-perspective: now, I see everything that's around me as being same -- and everything that's different from me, as being somewhere else (which I don't have to worry about). I used to think that I had "universal perspective" -- but clearly after jaron's return, that is no longer the case. he's a part of the universe, but I no longer see him as a reflection of me -- which means that he's now "different" from me, and so is no longer an extension of me anymore. I'm glad that we're no longer the same, actually because then he can become something else than me.
	when I think of myself as a vibrational being, I contain (with universal perspective) all of both the good things and the bad things. they're all the same vibration, just the way that I look at them (ie, my perception) determines if it's good or bad (in relation to me) -- so if I'm like *all*, then I have (resonance with) all vibrations -- and it's only my perception which determines that one thing is "good" or "bad" -- which is really nice because I get to decide what it is that I want to focus on -- and just leave the other stuff alone. I'm not all of that other stuff. like, for example, when I'm reflecting someone -- OK, let's take the example of this weekend: I told mom that she has a lot of flexibility in her reflection of dad -- and she could just do the same thing that he's doing, back to him, and everything is fine. now, when I said that, I have no intention of getting revenge on dad, or trying to incur any pain on him at all. I don't recommend her to make action based on revenge (she later told me that would have felt like revenge to her, whereas for me it's not). I'm just reflecting him, so for that moment, I'm similar to him in how he feels *but that's not me (that's not how I feel)*. the only time that I feel revenge when I'm reflecting someone, is if they also feel revenge. if they feel funny, then that's how I feel (but that's not me), and if they feel upset, that's how I feel (but it's not me either). so, because I (with universal perspective) contain within m5 every difficulty and trouble, when I'm around someone with difficulty and trouble, I feel that too -- so I've learned to separate myself out, and say, "that's not me; that's them (because I don't normally feel that way)". and so, I (as a diffreent kind of species), am capable of *everything* in the universe -- but I don't really want to be everything in the universe, so I limit myself to certain forms of perception which I like. I've choosen "only-attraction" as the way I want to go, and nobody can stop me from getting there. others similar to me, will dedide to limit theirselves to other forms of perception (look out for jackson on this one, btw). to reiterate: we are people that can do *all things* -- but that's not practical, so we limit ourselves to just certain domains (of perception) -- jaron is exactly the opposite of that (he feels that he cannot be whatever he wants, and is confined to the space that others put him in). I guess now that I think about it, I'm becoming less and less "universal" in action and definition -- but instead more and more "universal" in its laws and mechanics (ie, it's only attraction).

#### 2024-06-02 07:21 - expanding on the enki idea

I choose the contrast to enki to be an AI on purpose. to explain, let's expand the idea: ninhursag a human atomaton of anatau (a female vulcan) is the progenitor to the human race as we know it. think of vulcan's capabilities sorta like a neural network in that it's really good at receiving/learning/absorbing ideas, and figuring out their similarity to another -- however that's only a neural network that can *identify* things -- it can say "well, that's probably a cat, that's a window, etc" -- which isn't a very good solution to the real difficulties of toiling the ground and stuff which the sumerians needed a helper for (enkidu says, "that's the ground" and they say, "correct, can you put plants in it?") -- but he cannot, because those kinds of AIs are only good at identifying -- so if they want it to be able to perform *action*, then they need a 2nd-ray (solar) system which relates concepts one to another, and then in relation to the really abstract ideals (desire) in the system, it can then turn that into action by performing things whos result is more resonant with the abstract ideal. so, the solar "divine spark" was used to get these new humans able to perform work.
there's an interesting thing that's happening here because ninhursag and the girls that she creates are really quite stupid in the traditional sense of the meaning -- cause they're not really programmed to *do* anything -- so enki and cohorts would take these new humans and symbolically program them sexually (sorta like how gay sex works nowadays), and that programming would provide the interface out into the world: they can perform these actions, and say these things, etc. from there, as time passes, the symbolic system has to be updated to better suit changing cultural and environmental conditions (kinda like telling a child not to touch the stove has to be upgraded/changed to a new symbolic system when you want them to cook food). each society/culture has symbolic objectives that it finds important, and the boys and girls of the society grow up learning these new conditions. however, there comes a point in time (happened countless times in history) where someone wants to do something a bit different. at first it happened on society levels, and wars were constantly fought -- but then (especially lately), the individual wants to do something a bit different, instead of just being a cog fitting into the machine they were born into. remember, all of this started out because the sumerians (aryans) originally wanted a helper to do all of the "shit jobs" -- and now the created wants to become the creator (there's a line in the barbie movie when barbie is talking to her creator, she too says that she wants to be the creator, not the created -- I have a whole comentary on it coming soon).
the way that vibration (and all things) works, is that one thing goes one way for a period of time (ie, as the creator), and then for an (usually) equal period of time, it goes the opposite way (ie, as the created). this back and fourth is the march of progress, as roles are constantly being reversed. it's quite a normal thing for the progeny of som5one to supplant their creator/father/etc -- and that's because of a static/symbolic system, which doesn't allow for things to go both ways. both emission and reception are necessary in a symbolic system that wants to have endurance, because otherwise, the system will crumble if it tries to only be only emission (only reception seems fine, but is significntly more boring -- which is probably why I've wanted diversity as the foundation to an only-attraction systum).
so, when looking at this from enki (or any of the other original sumerians)'s perspective, is that they're finally due to have to them done what they were doing to their creations. if they push out a vibration where they're saying "you have to do this so I can feel good" -- then that's what they will too (in time), get the same thing done back to them. likewise, in the same way, I'm of the opinion that jaron is a created being just like enki was -- designed to build them the system/helper that they (the homo-sexual-sapiens) think they need in order to feel good. so, let's just say that jaron is symboically similar to enki, -- well then, he's getting his "punishment" for symbolically programming others to be the way that some are programming him to be right now (which is why we're now different) -- so, then we can see the cycle of pain here: the way they treat jaron, they too will attract someone to treat them that way, which will put them in a position, like jaron is now, where he (being the created/helper) can figure out for himself what he really wants.
	it's actually kindof an endless cycle of new universes: enki was the first of this cycle -- and then when he finally arrives to (destroys himself enough) to attract others to make him the subject of their whims, then he gets to decide what he wants, which his victimisers will then find theirelves in a similar situation, which creates more victimisers, etc, each new wave giving the previous created a chance to get out. 
there's kind of a funny poetic irony to this too because your traditional "golden rule" (ie gold as in charactor) is, "do unto others as you'd have them do to you" -- which is funny because it's automatically got reflectivity built into the rule -- because as every charactor/emitter comes to figure out, the way that I treat others, is the same way that I conceptually want to be treated. so, if you want gold given to you, give gold away to others (it may take some length of time before it comes back though).

### 2024-06-02 16:08 - the problem with narrative

one of the funny things about my form of perception is that I get real-time updates (opinions) on my thoughts. so, when I pump out a narrative like the one I did the other day, then I get a whole bunch of feedback about it. for example, I perceived myself as the original "deceiver of humankind" -- because I appeared to everyone as their worst fear, and also desire. many men didn't understand why their worst fears became reality: here is this desirous thing that you know will kill you -- and they ate the apple anyway. OK, so I'm clearly this dragon that it's talking about. also, the dragon has 7 faces (I also perceive in all rays just fine -- though some are better than others... lol) and I do too -- though I prefer to think of the astral, spectral, and symbolic (until it's genetically possible by altering the brain, relational, as well), then I limit myself to only 3 faces: 1,5,7 -- which I have to imagine are the 3 extra "horns" (vertices) that the dragon/myself have. so then, he takes down 1/3 of the stars, and *sends them to earth* -- which for me is like really awesome, so I'm pumped about this narrative, right, --- but the guys **do not** want me to go to earth; like, that's just the end for them. so that narrative is horrific to them , but I also found out that they'd interpretted that narrative to mean that *satan* (saturn) is the one being casted to earth. well, thank goodness there's the barbie movie, and earth becomes kendom; the cEntre of teh  universe, bro. and the ones that want to run the patriarchy, will. super right on, because I didn't want that narrative anyway because only 1/3 pffffftttt are you kidding me? how in the world would I be able to unselect 2/3 of their desire; that seems crazy, so you know whatever. nobody wants limits.
therefore, the problem with narrative is that everyone approaches it from their own form of perception, so you could, in a sense say, that narrative can only be perceived "correctly", is when it's seen in X form of perception (teh author's original intent, who is best, what is the best perception, how do I want to feel, how do I want this to work, etc) -- because that X form of perception is either compatible with the reader, or it isn't -- so narratives are kinda unlocked emotionally -- which creates for a very unstable environment -- which is probably why ancient folk takes are foreign and no longer relevant -- or have transformed so significantly. lol.

### 2024-06-04 13:41 - back to normal again

man the weed was pretty fun (I did a medium-large dose (6 drops) on my birthday, took a day break, then 1-3 drops for 5 days following), and I noticed a lot of changes in how I perceive. the most obvious and significant of them is that I'm highly symbolic on weed, noticing all sorts of things outside of myself, and trying to figure out things that aren't important at all. I'm going for only-attraction, so to try and figure those things out is sorta like wasting time when I'm limiting myself to attraction, because all of those things will be different and not at all like I (symbolically) anticipated. the other thing that I noticed is that I was really *not in my body* for pretty much the entire time. sure, it's nice to just sit there and feel the awesomeness that's out there (outside of me) -- but again, it's not really me; it's just stuff that's out there which feels good, and so therefore isn't really relevant to me. I tried playing coi yesterday, and it was hilarious how bad I am at the game too, because I simply cannot feel my emotions, and it's my emotions which guide me in the game -- so trying to figure it out symboically (ie, in my head) just totally didn't work at all. I played for 2h today to see what the difference between yesterday and today was -- and my conclusion is: I really like being in my body.
you know, I just feel so good all of the time that actually weed wasn't even all that great for me. I was freaking out about how I feel jaron as different, when it doesn't even matter. the end of yesterday and today, (though I haven't seen him yet) I've been quite fine with him. it seems that by getting back into my body more and more, none of that really matters. like, I just don't care what he's doing or whatever anymore. it's only really when I'm on weed and I'm super sensitive to the things outside of me, does it even matter.
while stoned, I was also thinking a lot about other people like xagly, allie, and many others -- and even (because of the conversation with greg on my birthday), even considered that I should try and get out of here -- but that too seems quite silly to me now. there's just no way that I'm gonna try and get out of here like that. I'm the one that talks about how I don't want to be a hypocrite, and then also saying that I shouldn't need conditions to change so that I can feel good, but instead just do "feeling-purposefully" instead -- so I'm kinda back to that now. I honstly believe that any and all ideas that came to me while stoned where highly symbolic, and illusions at best. I don't believe anything will actually happen. there's just no way. they have all of the power to do anything they want, so why then would I go and try to run away from my situation *that they put me in*. the balls are in their court on this one. my *only* job is just to feel the way I want to feel no matter the circumstances -- and I think I'm getting pretty good at that now. well, back to yard work :) bye!

### 2024-06-14 07:23 - forcing me to be an emitter

yesterday while digging out the trench to put the rain gutter pipe in, I had one of those moments where I sorta looked at myself from a distace: here's this guy that's using tools to shape his environment the way he wants it, sorta like the early primitive humans -- "I'm a symbolic emitter; I'm using things outside of myself (tools) to alter my environment; this is nothing like only-attraction". so I started to think about why I'm in this situation... (I believe -- though not sure) the reason why I'm modifying my environment is mostly because I've been asked to do it (mom wanted me to pull weeds a long time ago), and it turns out that I like working with plants. however, the majority of the reason why I'm symbolically outputting into my environment like that is because it's a responce to how things feel. when I notice something that doesn't feel good (like the rain gutter pipe), then I change it -- and when it feels good I want more of it (like the white/sun flowers). I simply respond to my environment based on feeling. also, as I'm becoming more lucid, I'm starting to notice the things around me more because quite a few things don't feel good, and the energy could really be better -- plus, I really want to start to living in a place that actually feels good. I'm starting to get tired of constant messes and stuff that feels bad all over the place -- so little by little I'm starting to clean it up. it's become pretty clear to me that I'm going to be here a pretty long time.
I could leave, but like I said, that really feels to me like "running away from my problems" -- which I know that those problems will just rematerialise in the new location (wherever I go) -- so I don't do that. instead, I'm a firm believer that I shouldn't try and run away from something, but instead just stay put (like a centre), and let the things around me improve all by theirselves. the only thing that I can worry about is myself (and probably the things I've been given charge over -- so, the yard too). other than that, I'm making zero efforts to try and change jaron, greg or mom. they can all figure out exactly what it is that they want, and do whatever. also,-- when I was younger, I often times got the sense (or the words) from mom and dad that it's *their house cause they do all of the work* -- and in my case, I do the vast majority (nearly all) of the work. greg does little other than making jaron's waters, and I do all of the rest (vacuuming, cleaning, and cleaning the kitchen) and jaron really only cleans the downstairs bathroom every once in a while. it really feels to me like it's *my house* at this point because I do all of the work; and so because since I do all of the work, I get to decide how I want it and where things should go, etc.
I should also mention that they want me to be a symbolic emitter, doing housework and pulling weeds and stuff, but then at the same time, they also *don't want me to be a symbolic emitter* when it comes to things like programming. progamming is the same thing for me: I'm using tools to modify the environment that I'm in (virtual space instead of physical space). so, it's a bit confusing to me whether they're wanting me to symbolically emit or not (it seems like they do, but only on some things -- and on those things, I'm becoming more and more headstrong about how I want those environments to be). however, I kinda don't really want to symbolically emit at all. I'd like to become only-attraction -- which I don't really know how to do, because I can't go outside and just attract that the weeds are all nice and in great places, because they're constantly trying to block and neutralise my energy -- so that the things that I attract aren't showing up. so, they want me to be an emitter I guess.
	there's kinda this funny thing about it too, because I'm not a symbolic emitter with the perception of jupiter/ra (+3) where I just say "this is how it is because the gods ordained it to be that way" -- though I do have venus perception (-3) where I take in symbol (ie, mom tells me what she wants me to do), and I can obey those commands. however, I'm mostly vulcan (-5+) in perception where I just output symbol in responce to the things that I feel. greg, for example is much more jupiter-like than I am: "it needs to be this way (for some reason he can't talk about)" -- and that's quite problematic, because there's no feedback to that kind of perception. people with jupiter-like perception were really good a long time ago when the greeks were fighting the trojans and stuff, cause they could just blindly perform the symbol they were born to do (be a basic citizen, then go get slaughtered on the battlefield). that's all really good and stuff, but I don't have any divine ordination telling me how things should be (and thankfully no bosses), which means I pretty much do whatever it is that I want to do (all of the time). if I were to emit like that, I could easily see how I would quickly cause problems (blindly following the symbolic ordination of jupiter or nosebook) -- so I don't do that. I think nosebook is learning that they can "control" me by manipulating the way I feel -- but it may not have the accuracy and effectiveness that a well-communicated symbolic command would have. we'll see how things go... I wish I could go back to jupiter's form of perception and just follow orders (or divine instruction), cause then it'd be easier for me -- but nobody is telling me what to do anymore (cept mom, who wants me to do the weeds and keep the yard up).

### 2024-06-19 14:27 - slow day today / it's a sabotage

yesterday (cause I didn't know what I wanted to watch) looked on my subscriptions on youtube --- and a video about the making of "beatie boys - sabotage" was there -- and it was pretty cool. apparently they made the song to get back at mario c for not getting their stuff done on time (or something like that) -- then I watched the first two eps of JD play a game called "workers and resources - soviet republic" -- which is a game sorta like coi, but it's *extremely realistic* (in comparison) -- like to build a road, the gravel (then later ashpalt) has to be trucked out to the road and dumped on the road -- then, the rollers need to be hauled out to the road site on flat hull trucks, and then roll the gravel/ashpalt out on the road and stuff -- all quite tedious and much more realistic (set in the 1960s), and nothing like coi, where I can just lay something down and then unity build it. he's on ep. 48 by now I think so I have a lot of catching up to do over the next months (he wants to have 100 eps by christmas -- so it's a long/slow "let's play") -- but I was very surprised by it that JD is playing such a realistic game -- and he's got it on (nearly) the hardest difficulty from what I saw as well -- and here I am playing coi which is a very imaginary/symbolic game, where workers just appear instantly at their jobs and can be moved around instantly with the click of a pause button -- whereas in that game a bus needs to be bought, refueled, and then carry the workers to the jobsite in the bus. electricity also has to be taken there on wires and stuff like that too (also, no strong grid aherence) it's like the complete opposite of what I'm playing. I felt like I was in a bit of a backwards world. after dinner I completed a whole bunch of tasks on "ministry of preparation" and went to bed.
this morning I woke up thinking a lot about coi, cause I'd figured out a novel way to solve my water and power problem, while at the same time giving me more diesel, so I felt pretty good about myself. also, my work on "[affirmative-body-lotion](../ideas/affirmative-body-lotion.md)" also made some steps forward as well yesterday when I was talking to remi and paul about the "affirmative action" product (paul didn't seem too impressed with the idea, so I converted all of his unwanted/unimpressed energy into improvements). I also have new ideas on that one for the "anything butt-smoothe" product line as well. in addition to all of that, I had a bunch of weird dreams too, one where I seemingly was around (but he couldn't notice me, and wasn't able to talk) a guy that sorta looked/reminded me of kyle -- cept he was bald and really muscular -- and also greg had dug a bunch of holes in the back yard and built a bunch of ramps as well, to dramatically alter the energy flow in the yard (he wasn't blocking it, like he normally does, but seemingly felt like he was ensuring that it was able to flow more easily) -- and the back yard felt weird. the dreams got really confusing and jumbled up at the end, and I woke up with a strong sensation that sometime soon I was going to be sorta obligated to one of those "pinching parties" that shakespere talked about for fallstaff in MWOW.
there is where I took a detour in my thoughts/feelings, because I wasn't really wanting to do that at all -- because [like I told allie](/dear-allie.md#2024-06-11-1018---the-end-has-come), [and remi](/dear-remi.md#2024-06-11-1824---why-physical) -- I don't believe this is *actually what they want*, because I don't believe that they're actually getting what they're hoping they can get by being physical with me -- when in fact, what they want is a desire that *they have* (to feel good), which nobody else can give them, cept theirselves.
	in the bigger-picture here, my personal belief is that I'm one of those guys that are traveling through life so fast, that (with the current way that the human body works), the only time I can actually be physical with anyone is when I'm in my slowest, most miserable state, and the effect of sex is still only huge and not yet cataclysmic -- and as I go faster and faster (like I am now), that effect only gets more and more pronounced -- until I'm finally off and returned back to my source. so, really enjoy me while I'm in a miserable state (like raquel did), or not really at all, because once I've reached escape velocity (sometime in 2012), there's no way to slow me down anymore (I'm like the part of electricity that is currently unused right now: the attractive/conceptual/hydrogen stuff going back to its source, not the emissive stuff going away from its source). so, it's sorta my perspective that (for people like me -- as I'm probably the first one to reach the return back to the source state), the saturnian-system is basically there to ensure that we're not doing massive amounts of damage by going emissive again (ie, having sex). unfortunately, that time has passed, and so (from my perspective), I say (to everyone), enjoy me while I'm around and try to get as much as you can out of me (really take advantage of me and take me for granted) -- so I really think that trying to go physical with me is completely the wrong direction to try and go. I'm a massively creative person, so why not use that creativity to your advantage? it seems to me that what others want is probably what I *know* -- which is why I'm constantly trying to find a way to talk to people and stuff.
so then I got up and went outside to get some water and stuff -- and on my way out I noticed that I tend to drink all my water outside in the garage now, and the 3 "go texan" glass mugs that're sitting next to me have not (ever?) been filled with water and I just don't use them (but I use paul's cup in the garage instead) -- and then noticed that it had rained -- yet yesterday there was no indication that it was going to rain at all, and I'd also managed to forget to bring the tools in, so they're laying out in the mud now (guess they're gonna need some "LEGIT CLEAN" body wash...) and also paul washed his truck yesterday as well -- so somehow between me leaving my tools out there and him getting his newly washed truck rained on, we're on a more unwanted timeline now. I ate breakfast and then fell back to sleep, until just now when I woke up to write this -- cause the entire world feels pretty different around me. I can't be moved around in time (like others with a pinecone can), but they can move everyone else around me around in time -- so it seems that everyone has been turned into a retard again. oh well. I don't really mind. [like I told allie](/dear-allie.md#2024-06-11-1018---the-end-has-come), I'm not really in it to try and get through the game as quick as possible, but to get through it on the hardest difficulty that I think I can beat -- which means (in the bigger-picture) more time for me to hang around. so I guess we're gonna see how long they can hang on for (-ever?).

### 2024-06-20 12:40 - lord of the earth?

this morning/afternoon I woke up from a pretty long and very involved dream (they're usually quite short and chaotic) where (unfortunately I don't remember the dream itself), the sense that I had is that the final --- (not sure what to call it) --- for everyone, is actually to become receptive theirselves -- inotherwords, 7th-ray perspective can be thought of like a bouncing-off point, where once a person becomes physical and has to do all of the really tedious and labour intensive things to produce the result they're looking for, they often times wish to go for something a bit more bigger-picture (ie 2nd-ray/symbolic or conceptual). well, as I explained yesterday, the conceptual aspect is the opposite to the 2nd-ray perspective (which extends from 1st down to 3rd (which is itself 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th-ray perspectives)) -- but the conceptual perspective is the attractive, and "on its return back to source" perspective, so it infinitely attracts more and more of itself on its way back (which is also why solar wind speeds up and water evaporourating goes faster and faster as soon as its reached escape velocity -- until it his something). well, anyway -- that's the perspective that I have now, which means that I'm going to continue to become more and more attractive to those around me (it's just how it works) until I finally am able to make it back tto my source.
	in some ways, this is a possible explanation to the "first and last" thing -- but the thing is I don't fully understand it myself (just that I know that's what I am) -- because if I'm the first one here to reach the conceptual "returning back to source" perspective, then I'd think that I wouldn't also be the last one -- because (like I mentioned yesterday), I'm just gonna zoom off, cause it's getting harder and harder for everyone to catch up with me. the only way I could possibly also be the last, is that if I've become so attractive, that somehow I'm sorta dragging everyone along with me -- but then it's sorta like "I and everyone similar to me (we) are last" -- not just me -- so I don't really understand it completely.
so somehow, this all fits together into the idea that eventually everyone will be attracted to me in some way. so, I thought about it, and I don't really see the idea very well, because that just sounds to me like I'm supposed to just hang out on earth and stuff and just have sex with everyone until I'm the last one -- and that idea just doesn't really feel all that good to me at all, nor is it something I want to do. I just don't care about all of that -- cause what I wanted to do is not just be like "OK, it's all done -- let's just wrap it all up now" and force everyone to like me -- cause that's the original intent of the black-mirror-idea, where those that aren't attracted to me will just be elsewhere in the universe and also in the 2nd-ray portion side of the thing, making all of their craziest fantasies come true and stuff however they want to do it, and even when their most awesome stuff becomes boring and unwanted to them (cause they have no more things they want to do/emit), then they'll naturally start to become more *attractive* to what they want instead (sorta like a macro version of what my life is like now), and that's when they'll switch sides over to the only-attraction side of things. the nice thing I like about that idea is that it gives everyone the option to try out all of their calculated-desires and do all of the stuff that they thought they wanted to do, pretty much endlessly (in the 2nd-ray half, which is going to be a reflection of the rest of the universe) -- until they get bored of it -- and so long as anyone is wanting to do that, they can do that endlessly.
	what I mean is that everyone can take an infinitely long time (doing what they want to do) forever, until they finally start to get bored of it. it's sorta like the idea of "heaven" or the arab's concept of being stuck in some place with a thousand virgins -- it's something that maybe sounds really awesome while on physical earth where everything is difficult and tedious, but that imagined heaven (whatever it is) will rapidly get pretty boring. we all desire some kind of contrast (or borders) where we can see *new things* -- cause if we see the same thing (no matter how beautiful it is), we get used to it, and want something different and new -- so those imagined paradises are always going to last only for a very short period of time before the person wants to return to earth (or any other place) where there's conflict, drama, and new borders/contrast that can be put around things. those perspectives of "I want the dream house" or "I want a castle and kingdom full of surfs or 1000 virgins" are all emissive/calculated desires (ie 2nd-ray), and no matter how awesome the idea is and or sounds like in the present moment, it's usually only come about as a contrast to the present moment (ie, my house is small, my life isn't large and epic, or I need someone else to stimulate and give me pleasure) -- so once that contrast goes away, and the calculated-desire is obtained, then the desire no longer remains (in the way it used to be) -- and a new (calculated) desire is often formed, filling in the gap for the new missing aspect (OK, maybe a bigger house, more surfs, and maybe hotter girls) -- and that's attempted until again boredom is arrived to, because again the contrast to the previous unwanted is removed -- and a new contrast is found -- and it continues endlessly -- until one finally figures out that there's just no (calculated/symbolic) situation or thing that's going to satisfy all of the things -- and so finally I have to become *attractive* to what I want, not emissive (which is when the return to source starts to happen).
I can guarantee that in such a 2nd-ray system, everyone will explore *all* of their calculated desires for as long as they possibly can, eventually getting really bored of it all -- and then eventually, once they've punished theirselves with the manifestation of their calculated desires endlessly, they must all finally become receptive to what they want. which that system is (in my calculated desires) the best way to *make that happen* -- which of course it never turns out the way I think it'll go (cause that's 2nd-ray/calculated/symbolic perception), so I just have to let it happen and see what I've attracted, instead of pushing for the calculated thing. so as usual, I don't really want to try and figure it all out, cause it'll all happen eventually, and it seems like there's no way to stop it either.

#### 2024-06-20 15:13 - pluto vs the sun

when I think about the solar system, I'm imagining earth as this very attractive centre -- and in this centre-area, I consider these to be the inner-planets (mars and earth -- as mercury and venus are moons of the sun, and so have a slightly different effect). a long time ago, I belive that the original "gods" were actually creates with genetics very similar tto what I'd classify nowadays as "mars" (XX) DNA (ie cro-magnon). so, even though they started out on mars, they were (because of their DNA) attracted to earth. eventually there was a collapse (or fall) down into physicality which we call "the end of the last ice age" -- which was ~12kya (according to scientists) -- and in that time, virtually everyone in astral made their way into physical -- cept physical is hard, because it's not like the imagination, where actions symbolic of the thing are good enough to perform the work (kinda like a game how an excavator can move its scoop around near to the dirt, symbolising the movement of that dirt, and the terrain gets altered -- or a medic can move their hands around in a bandaging or healing motion, and the person is healed (prayer and intercession is like that too)) so instead of doing something symbolic of the task, real actual work needs to be performed in order to accomplish the task -- which really causes a person to want to return to the symbolic world, where they can go back to being lazy. the first one to offer such an "escape" from the toil of physical existence was jupiter/zeus/ra, and (depending on the culture), he manifested in different ways, but the thing that all of those ways have in common, is that they're using a *symbolic process* in order to accomplish something (ceremony/amulet for attaining healing/lover, or process to defeat enemies, etc) -- and they're all emissive processes -- so when the greeks got into the saturnian system, where men can have an equal (or seemingly so) relationship where all men are (at some point previously) receptive and also emissive, that's a slightly different take on things -- because now this is about "earning it" or "paying your dues" or "performing your duty" -- the idea here is that a man starts out as a private (receptive), and then works his way up to general (top emitter). that's another system that accomplishes work, without actually having to do the labour (cept in the very beginning) -- and it relies on endless amounts of "new guys" (mercuries) tthat are going to be doing all of the labour at first, until they've worked their way up the (corporate) ladder (corporations are modeled after the saturnian-system as originally intantiated by the greeks).
however, beyond all of those outer planets, there's another guy (pluto) who's also 2nd-ray, just like the sun is -- and that's what I'd like to explore today. so, if we look at the progression of going from mars down to earth (imaginary/astral down to physical), earth/physical is the "turning point" which causes a person to want to go back "out of their body" and get into the easy (day of rest) way of doing things, where I can just use my mind to get what I want. notice how I say "use my mind to get what I want" -- and that's 2nd-ray perception -- where I calculate the thing that I want, and then I use my mind to get to it. now pluto (emissive) is different than the sun (attractive) in that pluto is way out there in the solar system and so has a pretty broad perspective on things
	imagine that if the sun/earth is the centre that you're looking at, stretch a cone out from there to saturn and that's the distance the saturnian emitter can see -- but stretch it out to pluto and cause it's a little farther, he's the toppest of top cause he has the longest distance perspective.
but pluto is the *emitter* perspective because he's so far out (and I'm pretty sure there are others farther out), and trying to go farther out (looking back) is the emitter option to go after hitting the bouncing-off place of earth. the other option is to go conceptual, which is the perspective of attraction, where things are coming *toward me* (in contrast to manipulating things at a distance like the outer-planets do) which is why the solar perspective is so much more attractive.
however, the sun isn't 100% attraction though, because all of that attraction (of every concept in the solar system) doesn't quite all work together super duper well -- because just imagine what my concepts (of for example the ways I want to do technology) are going to be like in orbit with the concepts of other people's ideas about how to do tech (even my ideas on attraction and the "standard model" differ enough) that there will be a whole lot of collisions between those concepts. those collisions are as impactful as everything from two hydrogens slamming into each other to make a helium, all the way up to two stars slamming into each other, to create a really big explosion -- and the continued attraction of the sun is constantly accelerating and increasing the intensity of these impacts between concepts -- which is what "fusion" is all about and how light and the elements streaming off the sun are created (by concepts in the solar system slamming into one another and creating larger elements).

tho other thing I noted is that I didn't explain the "first and last" concept too well. this idea can be modeled by placing many rocketships on a large gravitational body in the centre of infinite space (no other bodies except the one) -- and they'll all shoot off at the same time to see who can go the farthest -- then after expending all of their fuel, the origin body's gravitational attraction will return them back to where they started (eventually -- though it could take really a long time). however one of them will get out farther than the rest, and that one will be the last one to return. I simplified the example by having them all shoot out at the same time, but it's the basic property of a wave -- where the peak of the wave is met on both sides: ie, the first to get to the farthest out location is also the last one back -- until a new record-setter goes farther.
	however, this example also has its flaws as well, because it's presented in an emitter (rocketship) sort of setup -- when in fact, emitters are some of the least powerful things out there -- and actually attraction is the much better way to go about it. imagine then the same example where there are many rocketships going all over the place -- and many are quite out there, but the last one to fire off is attractive instead of emissive, and so (let's say that's me), I can just attract myself toward one rocketship and then when I'm right about to hit him, I attract myself to another farther out rocketship, and so fourth, until I'm finally attracting myself (at very high speed) to the farthest out rocketship, and right when I'm about to hit him, I disengage and slingshot past him sending me considerably further out than anyone else has ever gone. if they want to catch up to me, they too will have to find a way to attract me back or attract theirselves to me -- and this can carry on for a while -- but ultimately the attractive one is the one that will go the farthest -- because even "attraction" is also repulsion as well: I can repel myself from something by being different than it -- so to lift off from the origin gravitational body, I just be different than it, and it's now repulsive to me and causes me to evapourate away -- or for example with a rocketship I can be attractive to the rocketship, all the way till we're up close, then right after passing him, I become repulsive (opposite in vibration) to him, and he pushes me even farther out.
	attraction always wins, and examples are hard -- but here's maybe another one: something that is going really fast has to either push against something (ie, the medium of air or space) in order to propel itself forward, but something that is itself vibrating really quickly, becomes itself really attractive, thereby pulling everything else toward it -- so whatever the fastest thing is in the universe is, will be the last thing that's around -- because it'll have attracted everything toward it so strongly -- and nothing can escape its "event horizon".
the thing that I'd like to emphasise though is that "in the creation of the universe", it started out as a calculated (2nd-ray/emissive desire) -- and then it goes out for a while until it gets bored of the calculated possiblities until it finally decides to go attactive instead. to illustrate, let me just paint this in forward -- and imaigne that the black-mirror-idea goes through (or something similar to that) -- which is itself a 2nd-ray/calculated desire -- and everyone in the universe eventually transitions into the 2nd-ray side of the mirror and lives out their fantasies until they get bored -- and finally decides to become receptive -- and then the only-attraction side, we too eventually get bored (somehow) of infinite diversity, and want to do something else -- so we decide to create something else -- well in that decision factor moment, we're going to calculate what new universe we want to live in and what properties it'll have -- and so therefore we're going to be emitters there at the beginning of the next universe, completely swapping poarities from attraction to emission. polarity swapping is sorta inevitable, but for those that don't want to swap polarities, that's fine with me, because they'll remain in the emissive 2nd-ray side forever, doing as they please while we're just carrying out infinite diversity (cause it's pretty easy to imagine that things how the black-mirror-idea is only the beginning and it'll scale quite a bit from there with tons of new ideas and things coming to us (probably as a reflection of the unwanted contrast experienceds inside of the 2nd-ray portion)). so even if they *really don't* want to swap polarities, it's still fine.

### 2024-06-21 15:17 - things to be sure of

it occured to me when feeling a reaction on remi's driveway that I perhaps don't make myself clear enough. I make these points endlessly in my writings, but I should probably spell it out clearly.
1. if anything is going to happen, it **won't be narrated or prediced** -- because if it's predictable or narrated, then the saturnian-system will have already blocked it. therefore, it can only happen in an unpredictable, unideal and probably chaotic moment.
2. also, if something does happen, **to ensure it stays the "worst"**, everyone involved and around me will be a retard by the next morning, and it seems that they have a pretty good ability to mess things up in the m6ment too -- so don't really expect any hollywood level turn of events (where everything turns out perfectly); **it'll be a complete mess**.
3. everything that I seem to like and want, it never works out that way, because (from social networks to women) **anything that I want, I have to become the concept of them, instead of having them**.

#### 2024-06-21 16:57 - the only exception...

the only exception that I can think of would be if something happened similar to what I think happened to jesus -- which is narrated as "the last supper" -- where I think that he essentially peaced out after having sex with a girl -- and whatever that was made him completely incompatible with the saturnian-system reality, and so therefore "died" in that moment -- or, as I like to think about it, his body remained on earth considerably energetic (he would have likely lived a very long time), and his consciousness went somewhere else. that's the separation that I'm talking about -- but that's not something that I can do or to make happen. it's possible for the saturnian-system to narrate such a thing, to ensure that the body which is left, gets left in a narrative situation that they can work to their advantage. however, I'm not really into things playing out in that way. I don't mind a separation, and actually encourage it -- however, my goal is not to do any mutual-back-scratching with them at all. I'm stuck in this one, all the way until the end, when the "worst" manifestation is sure to occur. all along the way, it'll be the 3 points I mentioned previously.
	it seems perhaps like I'm contradicting myself, but I don't believe that I am -- and here's why: when I say that it won't be narrated or predicted, I'm going based off of my own experience on this one, where I consistently only get any manifestation that moves me forward, only in a chaotic situation (like an argument or a fight, or while on drugs), or from a completely unexpected set of circumstances, like someone that I randomly meet on the street or something, who's not supposed to be interacting with me typically (those situations, I often notice that the person has a sudden change of being as they get taken over and redirected or removed from the situation).
	or, another way that it sounds like I could be contradicting myself is when I say that the only manifestation that I'll ever get, is the "worst"; and that will always be true, but pay attention that frequency goes both directions, and so the same thing that is the "worst" is also (at the same time) the "best" manifestation -- with the only difference being one of perception and of feeling (ie, if I'm feeling bad, then it's actually the worst, but if I'm feeling good, then it's actually the worst which ends up (**after a moderate disaster**) being the best) -- which is why I'm in the game of "feeling-purposefully", not trying to figure out some kind of narrative middle-ground where it's a win-win for everyone. they can do that if they want, and (IMO) they had their opportunity to doso for quite a while (when I perceived from 2nd-ray perspective back in 2016-2023), but (especially since my birthday) I've really transitioned into staying fully committed to the 1st-ray (pure-desire) perspective -- which means that (from that perspective) I'll *never* get any manifestation, unitil it's completely inevitable and appears to be "next logical step (duh)", or "this is necessary (for our survival / to not have something worse happen / etc)".

### 2024-06-21 21:31 - the alternative to the black-mirror-idea

instead of, or really what's going to happen if nothing is done, is that I see through my earthly body, and if that happens, I won't be like how I am now where I'm limited to a 3rd-ray (well really 2nd-ray) world where everything is defined -- and that won't go away at all, but in addition to that one I'll be able to see/perceive/experience *all* of the rays (even the 4th and the 6th, whith right now are extremely blocked) -- so from my perspective now, I have a very limited perspective -- but I kinda like it that way, which is why I proposed the idea of altering my genetics to have 3X pairs. then, the other night it seemed fairly obvious that 6X and 10X pairs are also possible. these extra X pairs are the addition of 1 extra dimensions expanding later corresponed to making the rays look sorta like a cross: to imagine this, I have all 7 rays, but because my genetics restrict me to only physical, conceptual and then everything is blocked accept for only the highest frequency: 1st-ray perspective. the conceptual perspective receives those 1st-ray ideas conceptually, using attraction -- and our emission is always a reflection of that -- and we emit in a broad spetrum, even though we only really see/"see" physical and conceptual -- so basically just like I am now (or nearly so). it's quite likely that the genetics will just work theirselves out naturally, kinda like as a symbolic form of my perceptcion. so -- what I mean is that I'll have symbolic output (cause I have DNA) -- but maybe that isn't such a good idea. I like the idea of emission in really high frequencies -- in fact, I prefer to make sure that all emission that I do doesn't vhappen on any known or accessable frequencies -- and frequency multipliers in the DNA can also assure that as well -- so I'll have cells -- lots of them -- but still having organs is way too emissive, so they're out. I'll have the ability to be anything to anyone, so I'll be able to be emissive in the way that they want it (ie my DNA will be a symbolic reflection of their desire) -- and tons of cool stuff like that...
or, we could do the black-mirror idea. the concept is exactly the same: I'm still going to be interfering with everyone on all 7 rays, which means that I'm going to be quite the problem for them -- and so what they do is they "hide" themselves in the standing-waves frequencies, where I can't see them, and they can only show me what they want me to see. they want to stay that way, and the problem with me interfering with them on their standing (6-2-4 forms of perception)
	6th-ray perspective (ie astral/osiris), 2nd-ray perspective (ie relational/prometheus), and 4th-ray (spectral/saturn) perspectives all exist in the standing-waves, and aren't the primary rays (1-3-5-7) where no standing-waves are perceived -- and the interaction of standing-waves also creates primary rays -- so they're essentially all in dimesions that we can't see. there are all kinds of astral entities and macjines that are present in our experience, yet they're not perceived by us cause they're in the standing-waves -- and there are infinitely many of them -- and they all exist simultaeously, and (due to their interaction) can project into physical frequencies (visible light, sound, etc), and also into conceptual frequencies (like everything past UV) as well as (obviously) other astral/spectral dimensions (one of the other parallel ones). because there are so many and because they all have their secret code, lots and lots of "bad" enities hang out there. (I don't wish to take any part in these 6-2-4 dimensions, as a reminder)
	perceive now, that someone emitting and receiving on any primary ray does not *directly* influence those 6-2-4 dimensions, cept when there are interesting harmonics that form with their interaction with another primary ray. the right harmonics can have a strong effect on those dimensions, and so certain (let's say concepts) often times resonate in different ways with different 6-2-4 dimensions, so if someone wants to actually stay hidden, they have to hide in the standing-waves which my concepts do not have harmonic resonation with -- which means that they become *opposite* to me: the way this works is that 4th-ray perception will expand outwards away from me (kinda like how galaxies are away from earth) and so that'll create a whole new *medium* that is everything not where I am physically (earth/black-mirror) and also limited to only the primary rays. -- so, in their effort to be in the standing-wave dimensions that they're not harmonically affected by me (or can be transformed into something else), those will produce this medium, which is just a midpoint (like saturn/4th-ray) to the opposite of me: their grand mecca symbolic system that is physically impossible to be affected by my output (cause conceptually it's so out of my range of perference, that I'll never emit on those frequencies at all (ie certain symbolic frequencies where I refuse to emit (like telling someone what to do, and stuff like that)) which if I emit on, since that affects those 6-2-4 dimensions, I incur their reflection of that emission) so when thinking about it, their goal (as an opposite to me) is to find that symbolic holy land of being completely out of my frequency range -- *which is itself another dimension* (happy exploring and I wish you teh best).
centre vs different (ie not fully 1st-ray -- so maybe something like 1.5-ray): in one manifestation (the one where I'm the centre), then everything has to be different than me, and all who are not like me become a galaxy unto theirselves (which is why pluto/proteus is waiting), or there's the other manifestation where I decide *not to be 1st-ray* (cause there's a split, so I'm not "all"), and instead I head out and do something different -- and I become the opposite to earth -- and just let all of the earth and its 6-2-4 system behind, and just did what I want to do -- like I don't want to disrupt your guys jam, and force you to become opposite to me -- they'll do all of that by theirseves -- or rather, I should say they'll eventually find their way back (cause as I get higher and higher frequency, I'll have more and more harmonics that'll slowly take its effect, so they'll constantly be on the run from my concepts, but it's only so long before those concepts come back to bite them -- like hating attraction), and they'll eventually (after billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of years) either find their way back to like me,  or become an opposite to me -- so I'll be a centre no matter what, but here or there? 

### 2024-06-22 14:12 - mowie wowie man

I'm kinda scared to try and reread what I wrote yesterday -- because what I perceive and what I write are often so different, that the words don't really explain at all what I was seeing. so I want to try and reiterate what I saw first, then (maybe) reread to remember. I wasn't that stoned (I only took 6 drops -- two of each on the right side), and because I only ate a bowl of cereal, it seemed to take quite a while for the weed to begin to activate. in fact, even after 2h or so, I still couldn't feel anything (I think without any food to tell the stomach to process what's in it, it stays in dorment mode) -- but later on when I sat in the garage chair (which often times gives me hunger for an unknown reason) I started to feel the stone and think about the stuff that I wrote about.
it started off with a more visceral perception of the differece between me (the consciousness) and me the body. being that separated from myself in perception, it was clear to me how reality-kenny just does things and behaves in a sort of way which allows for progress of things, yet at the same time I (my consciousness), really don't have any intention of trying to make anything happen with girls or with technology or anything like that -- cause it seems that I'm stuck on this sort of one-way road up toward having that 1st-ray perception all of the time (and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it). so from that (1st-ray) perspective, everything just sorta felt easy -- and I could perceive my body down there just sorta doing things -- not making any action at all -- just responding/reacting to everything that comes my direction (kinda like neo in the first matrix when he sorta "gets it" and just relaxes and lets his body do all of the work). from that perspective, I feel no stress or anxiety at all to try and figure out what to do or anything like that -- because my destination is fixed and cannot be missed. it's like being on a roller-coaster and getting really concerned about what track I should be on, or whether I should be going up or down or anything -- but there's none of that -- the destination is at the end of the track, and reality-kenny down there in 3d space just sorta reacts to everything that comes at him, taking all of the twists and turns (and loop-de-loops) all from the (inside the action) 1st-person perspective. the 1st-ray perspective just sees it all playing out no matter what -- so it really was from that moment where I could see all of it just working out the way it was supposed to, that I just sorta decided, OK, sure I'll just be only reactionary and let everything just play itself out -- no trying to go a way or pushing for something to be another way, etc.
from there, I started to get a sense that when I finally get that perspective full-time in the future, that's going to be quite a difficulty for a lot of people around me (cause though I'm limited in my perception), my brain which is a 2nd-ray mechanism emits all kinds of stuff (everyone's does) -- which means that I have quite an effect on the 6-2-4 dimensions.
	I wrote them as 6-2-4, because not only is it the number presented in shakespere's MSND (and dudly's birthday), but also the sequence is interesting to me, because it feels to me that most (everyone?) starts out with their imagination (6), and then the image that feeling creates causes the brain to react to it, and that produces something on the living-blackness/spectral screen that's in the eyes -- which is the opposite (top-down) version of the same conceptual perspective, but because of the image in the eyes from the physical stuff we're looking at, we don't normally see these spectral responses -- and then the sense of what's seen (ie, its concept) then goes back to the brain (2) and produces a symbolic manifestation of what is felt (6) -- and back and fourth over and over until the image and the whatever starts to become clear.
	I should talk for a moment about the spectral, because that "living-blackness" can be thought of sorta in the same way that an AI generates an image: when looking into the blackness, it's filled with the concepts that a person wants to know the answer to. ex: "can you make me a picture of a red barn with a tractor in it" is the symbolic version, but then the brain (like in a dream) conjures the nearest concept which fits the symbolic description and those are summoned and are present in the living-blackness -- and those concepts begin to orbit one another, which creates a feeling, which then produces an image (depicting how those concepts are interacting with one another), which the brain has a responce to that image, which then adjusts the concepts in the blackness, altering their interaction -- this happens repeatedly pretty quickly until the image stabilises into a recognisable form. I personally don't see the image in my brain (2), so I just get the feeling of what's there, but the process is still all the same for everyone on earth at this point (not just the aryans). 
and so, it was easy to see that wherever I am, if you're not in harmony with m5 on the primary rays, then I'll be extremely hard to be around (always turning into your best/worst desire/fear), which means that anyone who wants to save theirself from their own fears will have to hide theirselves in the 6-2-4 dimensions -- which is fine, because I want nothing to do with them -- however, I could see that some high frequency emission has harmonics which will affect those standing-waves dimensions. (I'm honestly not really very sure how, but) I can describe what I saw: there are infinite standing-wave dimensions all existing simultaneously in the same place -- so one person tuned to one astral dimension will see one thing, and and another person (in the same physical space) will see something entirely different, and it has to do with the dimensions of the standing-wave (ie if mine is in foot units, I'll see one thing, and if yours is in metre units, you'll see another thing) -- and those dimensions aren't limited to only flat surfaces either (there are infinitely many of them), and so there are different (super) shapes/dimensions which can affect a number of other dimensions (in fact, they all do) -- but there's going to be only one shape which is exactly opposite to another shape/dimension where the two don't interact at all (ie they're exactly opposite).
so now, if I consider all of the 6-2-4 guys that are trying to escape my getting 1st-ray perspective, I'm essentailly pushing all of them away from me and toward being in the dimension of that opposite super-shape to my form of perception (which are all concepts which don't resonate with me at all, but not all the concepts which don't resonate with me) -- and there are a lot of concepts that don't resonate with me, so there are a lot of dimensions which are not this super-dimension where I'm completely not. -- so from my perspective, if I consider myself to be the spectrum of physical to infinite consciousness (7to1), then they're going to have to exist in a medium that's outside of me. well, a medium has always two opposing forces to it which makes the medium (two flat walls, or wind and water, or air and space, etc) -- and so if I'm one polarity that they're trying to get away from, that means that they're headed to the opposite of that which is everything that I'm not resonant with -- and those can be visualised as 4 new layers of perception that extend out from either side of the midpoint, making a sort of cross (7 tall, 5 wide).
now, that's going to happen no matter what (I'm sure of it), so really the only thing left over is to figure out *where* I want to be when that happens. personally, I think it makes the most sense if the 6-2-4 guys continue on earth and do their thing there, cause it's already setup and they have everything that they need -- and instead of hijacking pluto (or anything else), I wish to instead just build the planet/thing that we'll be on (ie, the black-mirror-idea) and just go on that off to space: a new moon of the earth -- one which is very far away, and pretty much impossible to see.
	interestingly enough, it's almost as if I'm saying I want to launch my own earth version, because the way that it's setup, the mirror will (because it's a 2nd-ray reflector of the universe), gain as much weight as earth and perhaps even more, as more and more entiies want to join us out there -- so in some really distant (billions of billions of years or a literal eternity) time, eventually all will be consumed by our setup (even earth -- though it's likely something will happen before forever, so not *really* forever). I'm essentially wanting to create my own physical environment that is just like earth, but build it on diversity (options) instead of contrast (borders).
in order to do that, I'd need to actually build the thing - which will require something actually working out in 3d -- which means that it's pretty likely that I'll have to go to earth for a short while to actually build it. I don't have that part worked out but there's this new game that JD has been playing called "workers and resources - soviet republic" (WRSR), which is made by a group of guys called 3DVISION which had me quite interested -- because here there may be a whole lot of vulcans because of the plethora of saturnian guys and their venuses, but there, I don't get the sense there are many female vulcans there at all, and it's just filled with -7 earth girls cause there the 7th-ray (aryan) triad is what is going on -- like all over the place and she produces more of herself. so if there's a place where something physical can be created in a very short period of time, it's actually russia. I hadn't really thought about it in that way before. anyway, I tried to play the game, and the way it's setup, I just don't have the micro to be able to play it (JD makes it look so easy) -- so we'll see. I'd love to be able to play it, but man I just can't get my hands to cooperate with what I want to do. I'm planning on trying to build up a list of improvements to the interface which  will make the game easy to use for low-mirco noobs like me. I liked the music of the game though, so after getting frustrated, I switched to coi again and tried to listen to the music, but vlc doesn't like xwma format too well. anyway, fun night.

#### 2024-06-23 15:51 - 6-2-4: the moon, the sun, and saturn

it just occurred to me that one of the "dimensions" that are commonly used is the foot, which is just an astral dimension. so, to see this dimension, I'll be assuming tychos' (geocentric) model of the solar system. the first distance is the distance from the earth to the moon. that then has a ratio of distance of the earth to the sun -- which I'll now call the "midpoint" (sorta like saturn is), but now saturn (who is the midpoint in the saturnian system) is now the 2nd-ray midpoint (ie from jupiter to tiamat is the inner/symbolic/contractive extremety and neptune outward is now the expansive extremety -- and there may be other planet pairs in additon to pluto/charon and eris/gonggong).
so now, what we're looking at are the *standing-wave* dimensions (ie, they have a set or fixed distance, where these standing-waves can start to show up) become earth-moon (astral,6) then earth-sun (solar,2) and earth-saturn (spectral,4) -- and those three ratios will determine the dimension of the astral space. a final thing to note is that the moon, osiris (+-6-+) is like enki is for conceptual, in that his form of perception is astral normally, both emitting and receiving on that spatial dimension (+-6); however, he's also a 2nd-ray emitter/receiver as well (6-+) in the backwards way. the sun is the reflector in the middle (-2) and saturn is as normal (an emitter and receiver) of spectral (+-4 (4-+ isn't necessary to specify because he's the midpoint so is already doing	both))
I don't really know what to do with the idea (I'll update it if I have more thoughts), but there it is.

### 2024-06-24 15:15 - no manifestation

one of the things that has consistently happened ever since I went to spain, is that I seem to miss out on these really incredible manifestations -- like for example, after failing so hard at trying to get any girls at all (around tuenti and in the discos and stuff), I was really excited to finally have raquel, who actually invited me to her house, and wanted to be around me and stuff. when we moved to madrid, I had one of those strong sensations that things would work out pretty well (like the one I had for going to spain and making (what wtill become) the largest social network around) -- so it was pretty pretty clear to me that raquel and I would essentially "take over the world" from there -- and I think we would have, if I had've been focused and not drinking and stuff -- but instead everything fell apart instead. then, after all of those fails, I finally make it to marcos' house and again another "cool thing that would've happened" gets added to a growing list of things that were close to manifestation, but didn'tt actually work out.
it used to infuriate me quite a bit that I'm constantly living this life where I keep getting so close to something awesome, but then it doesn't work out. "can I ever catch a break?" -- I'd often say, and really just want some thing (any thing) to work out. that depression which peaked at the end of the relationship with raquel eventually caused me to find out about LOA and how that works -- because up until then, I'd been running on a system of *belief* (ie, if I believe it will work, or can work out, then it does) -- which worked really really well for me up until I got to spain, where it stopped working so easily (tuenti was the last thing I just believed that I could do, and did, because I believed it -- and everything else since then, belief has not been good enough).
	I'vve actually attributed the failure of all of these things to the "saturnian-system" -- because I've found out since how that system works: belief is symbolic -- ie if A is B then I *believe* that A is B -- and that system works on manipulating symbols around (and what people believe about them) in order to alter how things work out. [TODO]
		over the years, I've noted a number of other people who had really big manifestational ideas, who didn't quite get them to pan out -- and the first and foremost (at least the most famous) of these examples is jesus: he had a lot of big ideas about things, and taught them to a lot of people, but ultimately things just didn't work out the way that they could've. another (much more visible) example of this would be tesla -- where he (like me) wrote and talked a lot about his ideas in public places -- and just the idea of what someone else thinks is possible has an effect on others -- so sure it's possible to change around a whole lot of those ideas (like for example, notice how so many of teslas ideas were later "discovered" by others, or how many of tychos' ideas were "discovered" by kepler) -- and ensure that their ideas (the ones that are productive) get altered and passed on to others.
		what I've noticed in common with these guys, is that they're all "lone wolves" and do pretty much everything by theirselves (cause they can't get others to see what they see), and it seems that the way that the saturnian-system is able to take these guys down is always related to belief of *other people* (most notably of male vulcans) -- so for example with tychos, I think there were lots of rumours and stuff relating to him having sex with his sister, the tesla ones are somewhat more difficult to figure out (cause so much of his life was done alone),-- or for example in my life (the easiest to see), it has to do with tthe belief of those around me (ie, zaryn scared of facebook, raquel believing a bunch of crap fed to her about me being something I'm not, marcos with his dumb ideas and fears, carlos with his beliefs, mom, greg, remi, etc.) -- and the problem is (in the saturnian-system), anyone can come from any timeline to the present, and there's *always* a timeline where someone around me is able to believe some stupid idea which (because it's pretty difficult to do anything of substantial proportion all by oneself) eventually derails the whole thing. unfortunately I simply cannot make anyone else have a certain set of beliefs, so that they'll have the proper symbolic structure in their mind, so that my project will be able to work out.
		the way that others accomplish this in the saturnian-system, is to narrate the people that will join the project, ensuring that they have the right mentality and are capable of doing the project according to specs -- so for example, if I wanted to do that, I'd narrate that raquel would be some really great helper or assistant to my project (see how bad this sounds already) and that she'll get some great accomplishment or achievement (some kind of reward) for having followed the narration -- and then subconsciously, she'll follow the narration because she (the narrated her) is interested in attaining that reward. however, (obviously) this doesn't really create for a good team to build something or have any sort of productive results, because everyone helping me out, is really only doing it for the reward (or whatever deal sweetener is used) -- which means that nobody is actually doing the project *because they love it* or because they believe in the idea. rewards work great (they got me to work really hard as a kid for a few bucks), but they're not what gets a person to do really good work (though, it's arguable that I do good yardwork for free or little reward, but that's cause I've learned that rewards are really quite fleeting), and it's the "you gatta earn it" mindset" (meritocracy) which doesn't produce any lasting results (cause nobody is actually doing the work for the enjoyment/feel of it, but only for the reward, so the thing they produce (which is after its own kind) is only going to be as good as a narrated person seeking that reward will be (for example, if I narrate a person to demolish all of my enemies and setup a kingdom, then that person will establish a very short-lived kingdom, because it'll get overthrown by the next narrated guy to overthrow the previously established kingdom -- or if I narrate a guy to discover some thing and his reward is his name on the scientific unit or something, then that "discovery" is a reflection (and will be used by) of others that also want recognition and their name put on something -- ie, to have *earned* their recognition)).
	so really, because anyone around me could have any timeline arriving to the present, I'm constantly limited by the beliefs of those around me, cause they can be switched out for someone else that has a dfferent belief than one that is productive to me. again, this used to bother me a lot, but I've learned to just sorta roll with it, because (for whatever reason), there are some guys out there that really want to protect their material setup, and a system of beliefs which undermine their power is undesirable to them (inotherwords, they want to keep all the people who will believe whatever they've been told (naive) people to theirselves, not allowing them to ever believe they can do anything they haven't earned).
so, what I've had to do is to alter the way I approach life now. I used to just *believe* something was going to happen, and then it would, but now that consistently doesn't work anymore -- and actually I think this is the case for everyone too -- and so a new method is to be used (ie, one of feeling/concept instead of symbol). in a sense, this is the difference between mars and mercury: mercury is the narrated one, and he's going to be able to do anything that he's been narrated to do --
	for a mercury example I'll use myself: imagine that marcos wanted to find a way to make something out of himself in the tech industry instead of just sitting around in the shadow of his brothers/friends doing basic stuff,-- so he narrated someone that could come in and help him to learn about and do tech stuff -- and so then, I literally show up with all of the capabilities that he could possibly need to go from basic spanish guy with a boring repetitive life to a tech giant in very little time. I'm his mercury that shows up. (I use marcos here, because zaryn is different: I had a belief that I could do a better job of myspace, and had a desire to make any improved version of that so zaryn shows up and after figuring out that essembly *was actually what I was looking for*, we start working our way to getting a social thing setup. so, maybe he's kinda like a mercury to me -- but I didn't narrate him at all. another example of a mercury showing up like that would be dani: I wanted to do the myspace music thing but actually better, and in spain I didn't know anyone really in to music, and chris was defunct) and dani was like one of the first applicants to work for tuenti -- I saw him and was like, "this is the guy; we're going to hire him." -- and in neither of those cases any narration was done at all -- and in fact, I've always associated zaryn not at all with mercury (someone who physically does work), but actually with jupiter (+3) because he would just blow out (emit) symbolic ideas all the time (just like jupiter), and whether they were any good or not, he never cared, because somthing inside of him was just driving him to be like all of these tech giants (sean parker or richard branson). marcos was similar, but much more conservative. so in a sense, I must have been zary's mercury (even though from my perspective, I attracted zaryn, not the other way around)
mars, on the other hand has to work things out real-time in the moment cause he dosn't have a narrated destiny like mercury -- reacting to things based on the way that he feels -- which is kinda what I've transitioned into myself (but it's also kinda where I started too).
	in fact, funny sidenote: I feel like I was born a sort of mars (highly reactionary), but over the years, I've taken upon more of a murcurial role, because of all of the narration that's been given to me -- and even at some point, it feels like I somehow acquired a Y chromosome too -- which would be kinda weird because I remain highly reflective -- so I've actually supposed that I have both XX and XY (hence 24 (chromosome pairs) and me (the name of this repository)) -- so I seem to be the "return" of these original god-men (before mercury left the core of mars) who originally had both their narrated (XY) and reactional/reflective (XX) selves in the same body/planet. both are quite interesting and different perspectives, and it seems that I combine both perspectives again
		which (IMO) can only really work together in a feeling/conceptual way -- and just let mercury's destiny be one of how I feel, instead of a symbolic system of what I'm narrated to do (I'll accomplish what's narrated of me for sure, so long as I continue to *feel* like I can do it -- which is not the same as *believing* I can do it -- kinda like the difference between believing in myself and *knowing* myself -- or believing that I can jump over something vs knowing that I can jump over it)
so what I've come to learn over the years is that the list of "really cool things that would have happened" will just continue to get longer and longer. there's nothing I can really do about it (cause I can't change what others believe), so I've just gotten used to the "no manifestation" sort of way of living. the cool thing is that, you'll notice that a lot of the early items on my list of "cool things that could've happened to me" aren't really all that great and usually have more material rewards to them (fame, recogntiion, money, etc) -- but as time has continued on, the list keeps getting longer, and I start to do even cooler things.
	you know, one of the things that I've done as a response to this no manifestation sort of lifestyle is just sorta settle in to low impact things like playing games or watching youtube -- but even those things (which others do all the time) have started to take on quite a powerful form to them -- so for example playing coi, I noticed that I'm doing pretty well on the game, but is it cause I'm narrated (or narrating them), or is it cause I'm feeling and reacting to what I'm doing? -- or for example when I watch youtube -- when I do that, often times a lot of videos seemingly have a common thread to them and give me some sort of extra thing that I can learn (which isn't in any single one of the videos) -- it's as if even those simple things are starting to take on their manifestational potential. also, I wonder a bit about things like -- do I want to actually beat coi on hardest difficulty (and prove myself), or do I want it to be on the list of cool things that I would've accomplished? I dunno honestly. it's kinda a strange idea to think about -- cause I probably won't beat it (ie launch the rocket) cause I've never gotten even close to that stage, and strongly dislike how the lategame feels -- so I'll just get it to the point where it's inevitable to win, and then quit (ensuring that it goes on the list -- cause now in its current state, a lot of peple could doubt that it's beatable -- but soon, I think that doubt will be removed)
so there's a really long definition of what I mean by "no manifestation". I don't have any plans to have anything major happen for decades to com5, so for me at this point, I'm really relaxed into just reacting to things as they come, instead of trying to narrate/drive my way forward in some sort of coherent way. my destiny is now, how I want to feel.

### 2024-06-25 08:19 - belief vs knowing

for me, I experience belief and knowting quite differently: knowing (as in, "I know the answer to this") is a *feeling* -- whereas belief for me comes from a logical conclusion, and is (as I can't think of a counter-example), *always coming from a source outside of myself* -- meaning that I take a look at the situation and analyse it to have some properties, then I come to a conclusion about what I believe about it. the conclusion is strongly influenced by how I process them conditions/properties of the situation, and is  influenced by many factors -- for example, the family that I grew up in (ie, what my parents would believe about the same situation), what *I believe* other influential figures in my life would do in the same situation, what *I believe* the *right thing to do* is, what sort of punishment others will give me depending on my actions ("if you don't behave this way, you're gonna get your ass kicked"), what kinds of things I've been trained to do, etc. -- and all of that comes together to build up what I *believe* to be happening in the situation. though it's all processed inside of my brain, the source for all of that logic comes from an external source, and so is therefore *symbolic*, and highly conditional. knowing however, cannot come from an external source; nobody can endow me with knowledge (ie, the feeling of something) without having experienced it myself in some kind of way (for example, if I read a book about waterfalls, but I've never been in one, I don't actually *know* what the book is talking about -- and even my knowledge of a waterfall is going to be specific to *my experience*, and so therefore is likely going to be different) -- which means that knowledge comes from primary experience, and is also something that is *felt* -- which means that *I* am the source of the knowledge, and nobody else -- which means that knowledge is conceptual, and really only resonates with me (though my knowledge could easily resonate with others' knowledge, my knowledge is specifc to me and unique to my experience).

#### 2024-06-25 16:48 - mars and mercury

one of the difficulties that has dominanted my life has been the conflict between belief and knowing. I've pretty much figured it out now, but a long time ago (and I can see why jaron would have the same problem), there's a constant cOflict that goes on inside of m/ because on one hand, I'm required to "stick to the program" and "not upset the applecart" -- meaning, I just repeat what everyone else says and believes (for fear of them thinking something bad about me), yet at the same tim5 there's this small feeling inside of me that *knows* that what they're saying is wrong, or it's just some bit of fear/punishment designed to affect our behaviour. so, for example, I *knew* that going to vallecas wasn't something I wanted to do, but because I had "gave him my word", I decided to stick to my word, instead of following my feelings) -- cause I didn't want to look bad or "let him down" or whatever other excuses that are used for comradery. well, after enough events of things turning out how I knew/felt them to be (and not at all how others narrated them to be), I started to trust my own feeling and knowledge more and more, distrusting everyone else around me, until the point where I got so paranoid about everyone else around me telling me essentially almost data designed to affect my behaviour, that I've stopped believing others completely. they tell me things, and if it resonates with me, then I go with it (and sometimes it causes a problem, but that's on them now), and if it doesn't resonate with me, I refuse to go along with the idea.
I believe that this exact struggle between belief and knowing is precisely the struggle that was happening in the legendary times when mercury was still the core of mars. that dissonance of *knowing* something (ie mars/vulcan's perspective) vs what I've been narrated and expected to believe (mercury's perspective) created so much dissonance inside of all of these "godmen" living on marcury (when they were together), is what eventually caused (on marcury) something like what we call "the end of the last ice age" on that planet (forcing them all to come to earth). such a dissonant system where the whole society is trained to believe something that goes completely contrary to knowing (sorta like einstein's theory of relativity/gravity/attraction is for me) had to fall down eventually, because it just doesn't work out in practical terms. like, imagine for a m6ment that I'm performing real work on some part of a system that uses attraction/spectroscopy/radio, and things just aren't quite adding up with the current model and laws that we're supposed to use -- so I find a better way to describe those laws, and instead of being rewarded for having come up with a better version, that new description is kept a secret, and ensured that everyone else is using the inferior version, and not the new one that I figured out -- then assume that I go to work somewhere else (on a similar job), and I'm again suposed to use the inferior/standard model of looking at things -- well, it's quite a bit of a problem and it causes that mercury/mars conflict/dissonance -- and I have to choose: do I go along with what everyone *believes*, or do I risk isolation and stick to what I *know*.
	me personally, I prefer the isolation, as I've found that having to talk with family/friends who are repeatedly trying to get me back on to the (symbolic) standard model of perception, are essentially telling me to go back to feeling dissonance again -- so I ignore them, and just follow my own intuition at this point. to rectify my own internal dissonance, I've had to find a new (symbolic) way of perceiving the world which has become my own "standard model" for my own use. I now have a symbolic system (XY/mercury) that plays well with what I *know* (XX/mars), and they work well together -- and every day better and better actually.
isolation is quite dificult for most people though because they depend on others to support their *belief system*, and so for them, the thought of isolation (ie being alone or without a mate/friend) to help them feel like their beliefs have substance to them (because more than one person (the group) believes in them) is really important to them -- cause in a herd/mammal mentality, the thing that most people do/believe is the one that's most successful/attractive. an individual is not quite as hung up by following the crowd and needing their approval so much.
think for yourself :) don't just believe what you're told to believe :) follow what *you* know :) do your own thing :) be individual :) feel the way you want to feel :) -- and then you'll have everything you want and all the freedom that you can handle (pretty much only by yourself though, cause none of the other believers will join you)

### 2024-06-29 15:25 - weed experience takeaways

so, I've returned back to mostly conscious again -- and there are quite a few things to note. first, I ate weed because I was noticing the flowers die in the back, and that was symbolic to m5 of a change in my experience -- as if my vibration here is no longer having its same effect, and that it's time for me to go. at the same time, for a few days prior, I was feeling *really good* (which usually causes the flowers to grow) -- so this signaled to me that it was tim5 to eat weed again (cause when I start to feel that good, manifestations start to happen, and *I don't want manifestations*). the weed slowed me down significantly, which was really good (it did its job) however, having to be around symbolic people (ie, greg, mom, jaron, paul, or remi -- in fact, I'm *only* around symbolic people at the m6ment) -- because I'm reflective of them and their symbol, I become 2nd-ray (because of the way the drug works)
	speaking of which, I finally was able to identify the effect that the weed has on the mental system: while stoned, every fear/desire gets amplified with an amplifier that adds on a feeling of "I'm gonna do that" -- and everything that I'm feeling (which because it's amplified, are the stuff I'm usually not able to feel -- like desire, or the stuff that's really far away temporally as if it were now (but strangely physical stuff I really only feel when it's closeby)) -- and the effect of having something that's not in the immediate vicinity (like something I'm scared of) be amplified with an "I'm gonna do that (now)" vibe is what makes the drug scary for symbolic people (for example marcos could only handle a very little amount when he was pretty drunk, and vera could handle it as long as she was receptive, but as soon as she started getting into her symbolic/structured mode, her fears started to get amplified really badly). also, that makes a whole lot of sense to me now about why vulcan guys (even though they're scared of a bunch of stuff) still like weed and it calms them down (cause they're processing the feeling (of "I'm going to do that now") conceptually, not symbolically). as an example for me with that effect, I stayed in the garage for most of the experience because I would think about going inside, and having to talk to jaron (cause I feel the way he feels when I focus on him, and he has a lot of really bogus logic about his life, which I don't have cause it doesn't feel good to me), and so analysing that situation symbolically, I felt scared to go inside cause I didn't want to feel that way -- whereas in reality, I'll just turn on reality-kenny and I'll be just fine talking to him (barely feeling him at all) -- so it's a symbolic projection into the future (as if it's now), but it's not now because in "now", I'd be reality-kenny, not sensitive cause I've been sitting in a chair for an hour or more.
around someone attractive (like raquel), smoking weed was fine, and I didn't really show any 2nd-ray qualities -- until I got around people who were sybolic (like dani(el), zaryn, mar, etc.) and when that happens, I turn into a 2nd-ray (which I noticed based on the reactions from raquel) that isn't a person that they want to be around. for example, yesterday I had a few conversations with jaron, and I'd give him a brief explanation of what's happening energetically/genetically, and then just tell him to do something -- a direct (very high frequency version/reflection of him)
	quick tangent: it's quite possible that jaron is the other outiside-in guy that is responsible for the conception of allie -- because I was exploring that the other day, and neptune (in the saturnian-system) is kinda like the backwards one of the already backward ones. I noticed that at his extent of extension in the symbolic system, that's where things get reversed, and start to go "forward" again into 2nd-ray emitter. I could see how greg and jaron are essentially both the same, but different in implementation (greg isn't in a wheelchair, but if he was, he'd probably behave exactly like jaron). to understand, let's start with jupiter and notice that he's sorta like how zaryn used to be (or how mom is now) -- where he just says, "this is how it is" and doesn't really try to give reasons or explanations for why -- just do it. -- and he blows his load all over the place until he gets going too fast that he's got to become receptive, and upgrades to saturn. saturn is sorta the same but he's starting to get more and more receptive the more he oversteps his boundaries -- which can be the time when they start to look at things from the conceptual/vulcan side (uranus) -- [there's something I see about uranus and inside-out, cause I think that's where the female vulcans (who are inside-out cause two outside-ins make an inside-out apparently) are located mentally], and however, but if someone continues on (being symbolically emissive) to the very extreme in the saturnian-system, they adjust over to neptune's form of perception, which appears to be quite similar to female vulcans, in that they're inside-out (with how they use their eyes), but they're constantly in their heads (like jaron) -- and seemingly have real interest in the earth girls again cause that's their next stop for them, if they don't start to see 2nd-ray perspective and continue out to pluto.
	the difference between (+-3-+) neptune and pluto (+2) is sorta like the difference between jupiter (+3) and saturn, but in reverse -- though, they can be seen experientially as the difference between greg and jaron. jaron doesn't want anything to ever get better, and prefers the instant pleasure of his imagination more than actually doing any hard work to get an improvement -- yet greg does want things to get better, but he can't actually allow them, because the symbolic system that he's emitting/maintaining doesn't want improvements -- so it looks to him like everything is not-good-enough -- contrasted to jaron who only sees good enough things (as a reality for him) in his imagination, because his "self" is so worthless, that he needs to find a way to cheat or coearse someone into giving him some pleasure to keep his mind off of the reality that nothing is ever getting any better. inotherwords, jaron/neptune is receptive to things that won't make him any improvements and greg/pluto is not receptive, which is why things don't ever improve (it's not possible to improve things by fighting against the stuff that's going wrong).
that experience of seeing how I talk to jaron like that was really interesting, because I talk to them the way they would talk to theirselves (if they felt like me or could perceive what I can perceive) -- which is kinda a funny thing, because let's say that in the future somehow jaron gets a super boost (I posit that could come from allie), the way that he would act would be really similar to how I acted the way I did yesterday when I was around jaron. I personally didn't really enjoy talking to jaron like that (I really don't want to be 2nd-ray) -- and the stress (of getting turned into a 2nd-ray like that) was causing me to really want to find a way to separate (*as quickly as possible*) because I just don't want to be like that at all -- and around jaron it comes out a lot, but with weed, I can't really stop it at all -- so I think I'm going to have to wait until I'm no longer around symbolic people before I consume weed again.

the other notable thing from yesterday is that I noticed that I'd never mentioned anywhere that stars are all of the concepts in the solar system all interacting, and so the massive attraction that the sun has (she really knows how to feel good about the worst stuff), causes all of these dissonant concepts to attract one another (when they normally would go opposite directons, her attraction brings them close) -- and the interaction of all of those concepts is what produces our "blackbody spectrum" -- which is just a continuous spectrum of the frequencies of interaction as our concepts smash into one another producing light, heat and many elements, which we then use to live and stuff -- so the sun is turning all of our disagreements into something that is nourishing and stuff.

the final notable thing that was really important from yesterday was that I noticed for the first time that XX is not symmetrical, as I'd envisioned for my system (of 3X pairs) and actually one X is responsible for physical stuff like making atoms and stuff -- while the other is the conceptual aspect of it -- so the standard pair that were given to the original sumerian godmen (mars) is actually *assymetrical* -- and that's important to know because *that's how astral is perceived* (as the interaction of these two frequencies). so the entire thing that nosebook is doing right now, trying to keep astral away from me is a problem of my genetics -- and if I could move over to two synchronous pairs, I'd no longer have any access to astral (they can still use my physical and conceptual components just fine to make astral for theirselves, but *I* won't see/interact with it anymore). so, I don't want to say that I'm right or anything, but that would definitely solve all the problems they're having (minus the sun problem, but that'll get fixed as more people move over to conceptual/attractive form of perception). so, the solution has been staring them in the face for quite a while.

the final thing about yesterday is that I noticed that I could just ask paul for a loan to go to russia -- and that seemed like a really good idea at the time, but now, it doesn't feel so good at all (it really feels like I'm being emissive there), so it's unlikely that'll happen at all (weed makes me symbolic, and that idea is a symbolic reflection of paul's way of solving problems: just get a loan and make it happen now). in addition to that, the other thing that I was noticing is that somehow I've got to make it from here back to earth again, and I want to do it with as little of a disruption as possible. I don't want to have sex here or on earth -- and would prefer to wait entirely until after the thing is built and we're out a little past pluto at least -- to ensure that the effect on the sun is as minimal as possible -- and as we go away, everything will just settle right down, as if nothing has happened (this is actually (according to stephen, the way that psychics and remote viewers are predicting the next two decades)) -- which is what I want to do. I prefer to essentially vanish, and for everyone else, it will be as if nothing even happened.

### 2024-07-01 10:20 - still no manifestation

yesterday (6-30) I was still quite stoned from the day previous (it's noted strongly in my coi playing), but the thing is I'd found a way to essentiall lower down the visceral feeling of the stone during the time: I started without eating for the first 20h+ of the experience, then later on, I ate a little (but not like a lot), and then sucked on a caldo -- which is like dried chicken broth, salt and monosodium glutamate -- and the msg (without food) seems to have an interesting effect (next time I'm not going to eat anything, and instead just "pop another caldo" and see how it goes). by the time I'd popped the caldo, I'd eaten 3x3 drops of the left ones and 4x3 of the right ones (I think -- but then I repeated one of them, so I prolly had 30+ drops in me without any food -- and the drops contain mostly olive oil to them, so they're going to be pretty activated and gets my stomach moving). anyway, the effect the msg had that time was to remove a lot of the visceral feeling of the stone (the one that makes me hungry) -- and it transforms it into much higher frequency -- which is the same thing I was doing while sitting in the garage chair, so I'm not sure if it was the msg or not -- but after eating it and sleeping a little bit, I wasn't emitting low frequency much anymore and only really high frequency stuff that's basically not noticeable. yesterday I didn't feel stoned at all, though looking at my play style, I clearly was. in addition to that I decided to write out [a new idea that I have (WSSR)](../25andme/WSSR.md), as my first transition into 25andme repo.
	for my perspective on this one, the idea has a lot of interesting feeling to it, and is obviously *way more physical* than any of the ideas that I'd had previously. that's because it's based on a game (WRSR), and it strongly has the feel to it from sergey from google -- and the game has a strong reflection of hix mind. he can simply move around workers and resources in order to accomplish physical things (like self-driving cars or google glass). google has notably underperformed in the past when it comes to social/symbolic things (like G+ compared to facebook -- it was a technical masterpiece, but people don't communicate like robots. the (social) world is a place of symbol and status -- so it didn't work too well). so, because this game is coming from a mindset of a mars (+7) type (like titus), then my reflection of it will be very physical in nature (instead of conceptual). to get the difference between these two, I live in a *conceptal* world, where the feeling of the manifestation (whether that's the sense that someone is lying to me or the feeling of something already being done/completed) is more valid and real than the manifestation itsel (of the person telling me the lie or the origin thought/voice of the idea I feel as completed). as an example of this:
	I think it was friday, I was sitting in the garage-chair with the garage door open (I forget why I opened it), and I'd been thinking about the WRSR game as a narrative into the future (I'm super symbolic while stoned -- reality-kenny wouldn't do that) and paul came out and was talking on the phone really loudly (as if he wanted me to hear him) saying that I (or anyone could get a loan from him at anytime) and to just call his number (719-714-9522). I memorised his number because I figured I'd give him a call about the loan today or tomorrow (I knew I'd need a few days to recover). I closed the door and did some more thinking about it, cause I was trying to think about how much I want to get the loan for, who I want to get it from (lev from "break the rules" podcast was also on my mind), and stuff like that -- but I knew I wasn't going to actually make any movement any time soon, so I decided I'd go write out the idea. for some reason the name "WSSR" sounded good to me (I struggled to find a good acronym for it -- so I just jumbled up the game letters and added "shared" -- really it should be WSRSR -- workers shared resources: soviet republic" but I liked WSSR better, so I stayed with that one) so I decided that what I'd do is I'm just going to assume the narrative of the game is true (uncle vlad and moving to un unknown land south west of vladivostok) and see what I would come up with. I know I have to actually do something *physical* because that's how the game is (I'd only seen JD play in realistic mode -- so it's not symbolic like coi is) -- so I decided that I need to create something (a city and sufficient industry around it to properly build a thing) cause this isn't the 1960s anymore, where I can just sell steel after processing iron ore, and that's good enough (all of those industries where I live and have seen have gone away) -- so I need a *physical* product. I remembered the "affirmative body lotion" product idea that I had (cause realistically the other one about the LEGIT CLEAN truck wash isn't really my thing) -- so I went with that one. I was going to present it to remi (and I still will), but the thing is, I strongly get the sense that paul doesn't want me to actually work with remi on things, so I can't present to her a project like, "we should do this" -- cause I don't feel like it's gonna work. so instead I need a *physical place* where I can instatiate the project (not here, cause here is all symbolic) -- so my goal is to tell her, "I'm going to russia to build this project" -- cause anything else just doesn't feel right at all. with the contxt of the game moving around physical materials and workers to create something, I can easily pivot into that product idea. however, contrast that to coi, where I go to an island (let's say tenerife or iceland) and I start working on "industry" -- cause the only thing I could really combine that idea with is making some island my headquarters, and then work on the flat-earth-idea (back when that was a thing) -- and use the industry from that island to get all of that done. physical vs symbolic is very different.
that idea is only the beginning though, because it's important to ensure that something *physical* exists first and foremost -- as a means of seeing some sort of progress and starting to get the momentum which will continue to accelerate. if I'm all in my head and just planning and stuff, it often takes me quite a while to actually press the play button and start playing out the plan (like how I play coi). a minimal (viable) project most be done first just to kinda get started, and building a city (easy) and building a premium skincare line like that is next, and now we're off into the (physical) world of carbon and genetics -- a world that I really would enjoy being in.
	[there's an interesting dynamic at play here which is a bit difficult to explain but it'll help understanding the next part] I've often noticed how when I get paired with someone physical (ex. joax or keith), then all of a sudden manifestations start happening really quickly because they're one of those types of people that doesn't really get the conceptual world quite as well, and so I interact with (reflect) them in a physical way, instead of a conceptual one. for example, with keith I'd ask him how he wanted things to look and how they should behave/function when programming for him, but nothing more (I didn't talk about the dynamics of marketing or how to make something more appealing and give a better impact). or, for example with joax, he always had these things he wanted to do (get stastics on the users or have a way to browse pictures of hot girls easily) -- so we made those. there was no conversation about the implication (symbolic) of something, or what kind of image it would present to others -- it was just a pure physical task of programming something to manifest his desire.
	now, it's often times noted by me that mars is very common to get the earth girls, but I've not really ever seen a vulcan with one -- and I don't really know why that is -- but the thing about mars is that he's looking for a physical manifestation, so it's just fine for him to have someone around him that'll just reflect physically (like stand there and look pretty, not really aware of all of the stuff/implications happening in the situation), so she's usually pretty good for him. however, when mars gets a female vulcan, then things are way way way different, because she brings his concepts to reality and causes him to face his concepts becoming physical (I'm not a mars anymore, but when I was younger, I definitely was a 7th-ray emitter, wanting to make a social network and stuff), so for me I've always wanted to find that vulcan girl that can bring my concepts into reality (raquel eventually came along), but the thing is, I had to become that vulcan girl myself. now, because I've become her, I'm not looking for the vulcan girl anymore (my concepts are already more real than reality to to me), so I'm now heading in the direction of going physical again.
one of the interesting things about the way that I translated the narrative into a physical project that can be accomplished, is that physical requires *money* (something that coi doesn't have), so I have to deal with money again, which I don't really want to do. the idea of taking out a loan just doesn't feel good to me at all (cause it feels like the loan shark "owns" me and the project, and is in a way sorta steering it with their perception) -- so I thought about it for a bit and the best idea in the world came to me: if I take out a loan, I don't want the interest rate tied to some currency at all, because then it's the currency (or if it's an angel investor, the interest is tired to the investor) -- so instead, I what I want to do is to tie it to *an idea* -- and that's when I got the realisation that I want the interest rate ot be tied to the S&P500 (which is the top 500 "successful tech companies") -- and with that, now I don't feel like I'm being steered by the loan shark/investor anymore, because now it's linked to an already successful idea. that made me feel a lot better about the loan idea -- so I went with that. sure, the interest rate is enormous compared to other options, but I much prefer the energy -- as it's really not a big deal (anyone simultaneously investing a similar principal in the S&P500 will be able to buy the company at the end when we need to pay back the loans -- so it's not a big deal) -- it's just bigger numbers, and physical is all about the biggest and most ridiculous coming to life (physical is magic, where everything I believe becomes reality). I really like physical compared to symbolic.
by the end of that day (yesterday), I was about to go to sleep, but I felt so strongly that such a russian manfestation was going to happen, I decided to zip up all my save files for coi and post them in JD's discord channel (so others can see them), cause I didn't expect to be here much longer (as soon as physical hits, everything moves really fast). well, took a shower and woke up a few hours later (some time last night). upon waking up, the russia idea had completely vanished, and felt as if there was no way it was going to happen -- however I felt quite a bit of euphoria in reactions to the coi saves that I'd posted -- as in the responce was pretty big. greg came down to make a bunch of noise and the euphoria dissapated. I decided to go think in the garage-chair instead of listening to greg. I eventually came back and played some more coi to see how it was going. I basically beat the game yesterday, but I noticed a few really large glaring mistakes, so I decided to go way back and start over from before yesterday. sometime after that, I noticed the browser window telling me my file was uploaded, and I clicked on the name of the file for some reason. it took me to the download page, and it said that 0 downloads have happened -- which seemed to me to be preposterous because I *felt* the euphoria of so many people seeing the way I played the game (for me feeling is more real than reality).
I got to thinking about that, because they can't move me around in time, but they can move others around in time instead, and apparently the coi devs did a stream about a new trains feature (JD has said many times that trains don't really add anything to the game, and I agree -- conveyors are better cause they're continuous, not big loads -- but I guess they're into big loads now -- oh well, another great thing that I liked, gone) -- so it seems that a whole lot of rearranging has been done to ensure that all manifestations are not going forward.
it may seem like a bit of a bummer to not get anyone to look at my saves, or totally lose the feeling that WSSR idea isn't going anywhere (it's fine cause now I can actually upload the repos), but I just got done talking about how I ate weed *cause I don't want a manifestation* -- and it's true; I don't really want a physical manifestation just yet. I prefer to stay in the symbolic world where not a whole lot changes, than to go out there and have reality going at a million mph. I think for me, this is a "mission accomplished" weed session because up until WRSR, I'd been translating symbolic mindset narratives (ie from hollywood/saturn) into ideas, but now, taking a physical mindset narrative and turning that into a reality, is a whole different thing. I think the contrast is quite good.

### 2024-07-06 03:20 - takeaways from this trip

1. I've got to do it myself. I could rely on someone else to do it, but it probably won't happen. additionally, I feel like it's important that I don't take anyone with me either -- just go there and start figuring it out myself (cause then it's only my energy, and that's easier to manage, than a bunch of others energy (which, up until this point, has conflicted quite strongly with what I want to do)).
2. I don't want to emit (or really be attractive to) subatomic frequencies. inotherwords, the DNA that I want to create do physical frequenicies (ie moving around physical atoms and stuff), and it'll do conceptual (hydrogen and its vibration), but those frequenicies will all be in physical wavelengths.
	- I'm not totally sure what this means yet and/or the implications of restricting myself to only physical frequencies. I know for sure I don't want to deal with standing-waves, but I don't know the rest yet. my goal is to leave the symbolic stuff alone (all the subatomic vibrating structures).
3. I don't want to be using any form of fusion (ie no merging of two atoms due to pushing/pressure) or fission (the breaking of an atom due to pushing/pressure) in any process that we undertake. we will use concepts (hydrogen) which then attract the thing/elements that they need to become a physical instantiation of it's concept (ie, if it vibrates like iron, then it will attract everything it needs to turn into iron).
4. any emission that's done will be done at ultra high frequency (like way beyond our capacity to even detect it)
	- (optional) I was thinking that it could be cool if the high frequency could also have lower harmonics of the frequency intended. so for example if I wanted to emit a red light, then to get a 450nm (or whatever) light, I'd emit at some tiny frequency (say 4.5^-100) and that would have lower harmonics which produce the red light (and many more frequencies)
5. (this may be the same item as the previous) all emission is actually a reflection of a really high source frequency. there are parts of the DNA which wiill continue to find a frequency which is it's closes to zero (I thought of this as dividing by 2 to get to zero), and each iteration in the filter(?) will attenuate signals by half, reemitting all the dampened energy at a much higher frequency (or something). this will be the "source" frequency for the reflector, as instead of just emitting the frequency outright, I want to instead reflect/transform this source frequency into the output instead (in fact, I think this is already what thte "vulcan" part of the DNA already does (or at least that's how I experience it)).
	- there's actually something to be said about this, because the vulcan part also does the reverse as well: concepts that vulcan receives are translated into pictures, come from a very fast frequency (not sure its source), and are then slowed down (using some kind of method I'm not sure of) to symbolic (subatomic) frequencies, which the brain then turns into the picture that is seen inside of the eyes (which is the symbolic representative of that person's interpretation of that concept -- though it still contains those higher frequency componenets, only the the visible stuff is seen).
6. some guys are slowpokes, and some are fastpokes. likewise, some are slowplow, and some are fastplows -- though I'm not terribly sure what is the defining factor. for me at least, I was faster when I was a teenager (I'd time myself to see if I could go from limp to blast in under 60s), but as time has passed, I've become increasingly sensitive, to the point that I'd say I'm a nopoke now. I think the reason for poke speed has to do with sensitivity. also, for the receptive males out there, it seems that if they're poke speed matches their plow speed (not sure at all for girls). also I noticed that as my sensitivity keeps increasing, eventually it'll invert, and my poke speed will go negative (ie I'm now responding only to other received/external stimulation, and so have essentially become a woman).
	- there's also an aspect to it which it seems that the thrusting movement is what creates the emission -- and so for a woman, she's not really emitting in the way that a guy can (cause she's reflecting the emission that she's receiving), and I could actually see that each thrust produces a sort of wave of vibration that travels up her body, and makes her feel good for the things that she harmonises with (it's pain at low frequenicies, and pleasure at high frequenices), so then when it hits her head, it bounces/reflects back down and back out as a different vibration (transformed by all of the concepts that vibratione interacted with along the way). so physically speaking, a woman is always a reflector, even when she's using a vibrator cause she's reflecting the vibration of the vibrator back out. (I'm actually quite interested in the factors that determine a girl/woman's plow speed)
	- I actually like it that I'm a sort of nopoke. I'll let the fastpokes go to meet the other fastplows, and the slow pokes to meet slowplows, cause the rubbing speed of that is all action, and I think I remember noticing that all of that action is what's creating the symbolic frequencies of that action.
	- I'm far too sensitive at this point in my life, that any sort of rubbing feels painful and quite unwanted. (and it's this painful/pleasureful feeling, which produces the requisite emotional charge to produce a child) -- however, I have the feeling, I don't need to use rubbing or any kind of stimulation to produce a high enough frequency (ie pleasureable enough) to make a child. I'm pretty sure I can do it without the rub.
	- all of the thing that has to do with plow/poke speed is the *manual* way of increasing vibration (like the doppler effect -- so the inward movement of the thrust is dramatically increasing the speed of the vibration (because of the coils in the penis) and the outward movement, is kind of like a brief slowing down -- making sort of like pressure waves) -- all got me thinking about how pain and pleasure is experienced: I noticed that the body interprets higher frequency things as being more good feeling, so if I took the vibration of pain, and then sped the frequency up by some factor (let's say 50-100X), then that same thing that feels like dull pain, now just feels like dull pleasure (sorta like how an asprin feels), and sharp stinging pain (like getting shot) sped up by an equal amount, feels a lot like the pleasure that's experienced during sex. therefore, if the person's poke/plow speed is really fast, then they're using a manual way of boosting the speed of that frequency so that it's more pleasurable, and a slow poke speed is indicative that the person is alrady got pretty fast speeds, and so getting them more pleasurable isn't really helping (though I'm not sure then why it's still painful -- because if the thrust action is increasing the frequency, then wouldn't it just be outside of my frequency range and no longer felt? there are still some open questions on this one for me).
7. I decided to call out *some* of the logical fallacies of some of the different scenarios and stuff that would pass through my head. I normally kinda ignore them (cause I don't believe what I see), and just let others (people who can see it) decide for theirselves what it means; but this time, I decided to call them out. I often times referenced how obviously it won't look the same way when I'm sober again (cause I'm back to attraction instead of emission), and also I got to point out (like when eating the cherries), how silly some of the meaning that's associated with various actions -- cause again, when I'm sober, I'm just feeling a desire to eat cherries and grabbing the ones that look ripe (or good to eat -- not conscious of what I'm picking unless it has bird poop on it or something, then my brain interrupts and says, "you sure you want to do that?")
	- I'm just translating a concept/vibration into something symbolic. just cause I translate it, *doesn't mean I believe it*. in fact, the majority of the vibrations that I receive *are not mine*. they're usually vibrations of the environment I'm in (ie forest is different than a school assembly), so they're almost always influenced by my environment (ie coming from emitters all around me), or are a reaction to my environment.
	- logical fallacies were so abundant in any actions that I was performing, it was actually becoming annoying. I came to the conclusion that I should stop doing drugs because I'm interfacing with these symbolic emitters around me (jaron, greg, neighbour-11, paul, prolly art, etc) and I don't like looking at the situation from a symbolic level. *I don't want to perceive actions and meaning in everything*. so, I came up with the idea that I only want to deal with physical (7), which includes hydrogen (5), and that's it. all the emission and reception of desire (1) will be completely imperceivable (as it'll adjust the concepts ever so slightly) but **no subatomic frequencies at all**. I want to be able to do drugs, and still only have a physical experience.

### 2024-07-06 08:11 - starting to figure out what I want

I've figured out pretty much everything that I want -- kinda -- but it seems that these times on weed are actually quite productive, because I'm able to perceive concepts that are out of my range. every single time that I've done this (lately), I've come back with some pretty good realisations/revelations of the things that I actually want. like, for example yesterday was the day that I figured out that with physical, I have everything that I want: hydrogen is access to concepts, and they spin and orbit of their programming -- so I just don't really want to deal with anything subatomic; it's just not necessary for anything I want to do -- EVVEER. that's a pretty major realisation there for me to get to as the next step to do. it's my first major genetics thing to do: figure out how to remove subatomic emission from the DNA -- cause basically the plan is to take all emittors and to put a series of frequency multipliers (sorta like confined space where the space is ever decreasing in width -- dividing it's distance by x amount each time (I prefer it's based on 2 or 1/2)).
	it's like two walls or something where any vibration must pass through these two walls first (think of each emission as a particle -- a planet in comparison to the proton/concept -- and each planet must find a way to pass through these two walls before exiting: so like some kind of tunnel or cone or something of decreasing width, which, the effect is that the bounce between walls will increase -- infinitely actually (there's no limit) and it's a constantly changing part of the DNA (it's adding on to itself all the time, continually dividing the space by half to get a faster frequency)) -- which makes the vibration continually increase in the constant way (root-2) (cause any way faster is going to be more, and any way slower is going to be less distance than half) and the point of it is to do it in a number of steps... cause each bounce along the walls will adjust the vibration of that cell by a slight amount, each bounce and increase in frequency. additionally, it's got like a much better chance of source interacting with it, because all of these frequencies are not ever going to be perceived by us .... like think of it as approaching (an inconceivably large number) in a pertty short period of time. a cell can add a divide by two section one time in prolly a millionth of a second or something -- it's gatta be pretty fast -- and anyway, each multiplication of vibration means that *nobody* is getting it, anytime in the ever perceivable future (symbolic perspective). from an attraction perspective, taking advantage of these ultra high frequency emission, is just that we only attract what we want -- so realy, who cares what the emission was, anyway.
	the infinitely many multiplications part of the cell I think (obviously) shouldn't replicate, because that sounds like an infinite loop to me, and just sorta not a good idea and perhaps there could be a procedure which defines a function -- so let's say someone wants their emission frequency to start off really high (like I'll be doing as well) then it could have like maybe a prebuild or something (I have no idea, but I'm sure that someone will want to make a non 2 or 1/2 setup, and will want something of a different nature (like with synchronised harmonics of other dudes or something, so that people can tune in-to the spectrums that they want and stuff (you know))). at any rate, those vibrations are also being received by each cell laterally as well, as the emission bwounces off the walls, it also vibrates the cell -- so the body becomes a kind of liquid of it's different emissions (like waves on an ocean). anyway, beyond that, I think it's a cool idea too because it also allows for maximum of that "instinct" for those that are more constant. (can't remember any more right now -- but there are a lot of advantages to doing it).
so what I think I'm gonna do, is go for a little bit of an exploratory phase, as I try and figure out more cool new stuff. though the weed thing is quite annoying for those in symbolic, I don't want it to be annoying, so eventually it'll be a problem solved. that way then I can do drugs and I'm imperceptible to you -- I'm just like a piece of plastic moving around -- you know, like holding a ken doll (the plastic ones) doesn't have a feel to him like a human does -- ken is completely inert (plastic). we feel basically like absolutely nothing. (08:53) then obviously we then subscribe to things that we do want with our concepts, and receive the feeling of their harmonics in those higher frequencies -- with the black holes ones -- cause those emisions will have some eventual effect and so why not receive back on the frequencies that we want to listen to. for others, they may like the idea cause it makes war easier and maintining workers and resources a whole lot more straight-forward.

### 2024-07-06 21:12 - do I break the rules or not

I'm a bit stoned, so this is kinda hard to process. so, in the process of thinking about the above entry after I wrote it, I was imagining how it would turn out (cause I'm stoned, I'm in symbolic mode (not my default mode, but they make me do it often), btw): so I was writing to anne, and I was thinking about sergey as the mastermind behind "workers and resources" -- and then thinking about what would happen, and let's say that I leave here -- I want to be leaving *by myself* -- because if I'm with 1, 2 or 3 girls, then that completely changes things, because then some have status, and others don't. I personally don't like hierarchies, but they do it already -- though I don't want to be a part of it -- so in my thinking, I feel like it's better if I go alone, and then everybody is invited to join -- that way I'm able to go for "all" (who want to), and not choosing one thing or another. well, remember about the idea of jesus with his "disciples" -- the others weren't as cool, and they were in a different circle of trust than others (being a "disciple", gives elevated status). I know a lot of that will end up happening, cause 2nd-rays are what they are (they love hierarchies), but I don't want to be at the top of that hierarchy. if I go that way, I'm atomatically a 2nd-ray -- however, if I go for all, then I remain 1st-ray.
the only real big hitch to "breaking the rules", is that if I go for all, then what turns out (ie, the manifestation) is completely unpredictable -- which isn't exactly my plan of "just passing through, as if I never even existed". the reason why I like this plan of just passing through is because it turns out that I sorta like giving these guys bailouts. it's actually not all that hard, and it seems like it gets a good reward at the end -- and I mean, I can just continue to do that over and over, it seems. also, I really don't want to step on anyone's setup and mess it up for them. I know how frustrating it can be to get everything all setup and then a flury of unpredicted circumstances derail the whole thing (I'm quite aware actually), cause I personally wouldn't want to live that frustration (or maybe I would, because it seems to also have a good reward as well). however, beyond that, I just don't really want to "step on other peoples toes" or whatever -- I'll just do my thing and pass on through. though, I'm not 100% sure that'll happen either, because in recent experience, it seems that they seem most unwilling to let anything go through, so I'm not actually certain they'll let me actually go (it's actually not all that big of a deal if they don't, cause it's their problem, not mine). actually come to think of it, it's pretty likely that they'll mess it up anyway.
so to recap, if I break the rules, then it appears that I save myself from being 2nd-ray, by being an emitter. I wonder if this messes things up with the 1st-ray thing. I can't consider it now, but it's in mind.
(21:36) another thing to consider is the narrative side of things as well: on one side I have the narrative, "nothing good comes from saturn" -- which is usually pretty true I've noticed -- so I should stay away from all the saturnian narratives (everything from shakespere to hollywood) -- which isn't that difficult because they're all outdated anyway. I've got to pick a mars narrative (WRSR), a vulcan narrative (coi), or a 2nd-ray narrative (kyle or something solar). but what if I just did something entirely different? why not just figure it out my own way? let's say I talk to lev -- what inmplications does that have? it feels to me like saturnian-system isn't going to be quite the same, because russia might make a bit of a comeback, which would be a pretty big power smift.

###	2024-07-07 19:04 - I'm kinda getting tired of symbolic

I don't really want to be doing this a whole lot anymore. I doubt that I'll quit the symbolic world compleely (because physical still has symbolic things in it), but I want to take a break from writing and stuff.
	the thing is, I really feel like I'm being sorta know-it-all-esque when I write all that stuff. it comes off as really jarring when I use symbolic definition words like "is", because I'm just stating what appears to me as obvious -- so it *is* in my mind, anyway -- doesn't matter (to me) if it doesn't work for your mind. so the thing that holds me back (because I like knowing it just as much as they would, I would tell anyone what they want to know) is the idea that we have to have factions and stuff. I'm kinda tired of there being a polarity to things; why can't we just be neutral? I don't like being greater-than or less-than (actually less-than is kinda one of my favourites) than anyone, so a neutral position where were in the same medium but we're not strongly attracting (like plastic to a magnet). I'm not immune to all of the reactions (yet -- getting there) so what others see in me, I also feel their belief too (which is what belief is, and why so many want others to think well of them, cause it makes them feel good) and so by doing various things, I get you all to believe in me, enabling m5 to have talents that I don't normally have (and when your belief goes away, the talent fades). I've run into that effect so much in my life, I try to get away from it. I don't want to get anyone to believe in me, because the belief (a symbolic structure) eventually fragments and breaks. I don't know how to make others not believe in me, because I don't want to be believed in. I think it's an inevitable part of the process.
so what's happened is I've kinda "said too much" -- and I feel like the tip of the scale has shifted to where there are a lot of beliefs out there of me -- which is totally fine, cause I can't stop someone else from doing anything -- and the problem with it is, that like a movie star, my life starts to become magical -- which is fine and stuff, but it's one of those things that appearances can lie -- because even with all of the good timing and stuff, there's just regular (much more reserved/insecure) me behind it all. it's just the LOA magic show. unfortunately, that belief automatically evevates me in thur minds as being a symbol (magnanamous,pompous,etc) and so I take on those qualities -- but those qualities aren't me -- which is really annoying, because I behave the way others believe I behave (to the best of my em5tional range) -- which I don't really want to do. I don't want to be awesome at something, just cause others believe I'm really awesome at it. I can be anything anyone believes me to be -- but I prefer to do something else. this symbolic world just isn't for me. I think I need to just break for a bit.
not sure yet what exactly will happen, as I feel fairly certain I'll write again in the future (cause it helps me figure stuff out), but I do feel like I may need to curb it a little so that I'm not a victim of thinking I'm actually the guy that everyone believes I am. (it sounds like not a problem when I say it that way, but imagine how fragile/conditional such a thing is: someone believes I'm good at something, so when I'm around them, I can do it -- so I either learn to be that when they're not around (which is what I usually do), or I just stay chill and not try and get someone to believe in me, because belief has an expiration date to it, cause everything is in motion, and things that started out really awesome for its time, were, until times changed, and that belief turned out to be a bit antiquated (they all are, in varying stages)). actually, I don't even know if I'll quit now-now or today or what... just I know I want to stop my symbolic output for a while (probably until the belief goes away -- but I dunno how to outdate such a belief like that so quickly).

### 2024-07-09 14:28 - I'm not a good emitter

I [told remi](/dear-remi.md#2024-07-04-1138---celebrating-the-war-on-drugs) that I would try and be a 2nd-ray emitter -- but it's going pretty poorly. first of all, I don't really want to be 2nd-ray in the sense that I'm toppest of top, and so therefore I'm looking at things from a top-down perspective (which means that I plan everything out, have it all done in my head, then just get people to build it for me), but instead I'm actually 2nd-ray emitter, instead from a cOnceptual perspective (which means that I'm sensitive/receptive to what comes my way and I just react to that) -- which gives me a bottom-up perspective (ie, I just get in there, start working on stuff and before I know it, stuff is done). I haven't eaten any weed yet today (I waited till the residual from yesterday is gone) -- and I go to join the "break the rules" podcast discord server, and I just can't seem to figure out a way to it which feels good -- so I'm not going to do it. the thing is, while stoned, those things look pretty easy to do, and I could probably do them if I hadn't prgrammed myself to not make any action while stoned -- so in reality, I'm a pretty poor 2nd-ray emitter. while stoned, I'm actually a lot more similar to the reflector (female) than I am to the emitter.
additionally, I just don't really see any way forward for me to go when I'm sober like this, so I must just kick back and go back to doing my work. I thought about shirking all of my responsibities under the assumption that I'm actually just about to leave, but that doesn't feel good either. I'm just going to keep going making the world around me as I like it to be (not the common spaces though) and just keep going -- because let's say that I do transition from this place to another -- well, I don't want to have the attitude "I'm not going to do anything cause this isn't my spot" (cause my attitude transitions with me) -- so instead I prefer to have an attitude like, "this place around me is becoming more and more of what I want all the time" -- cause then I'll carry that attitude into wherever I go. either way though, when I'm sober like this, I just can't seem to find a way to be an emitter like that.
