### 2024-03-29 14:24 - initial thoughts

I've yet to write the README file for this repo, but I wanted to brainstorm and put some ideas out there first.
the name of the repo is a bit of wordplay, because I turn 24 about this time or yesterday. normally I feel both kenny's and my birthday's pretty strongly, and for example last year, I felt kenny's (it's weird talking about myself in 3rd person, just I want to make a distinction between "me" and "kenny") 40'th birthday at around 05-21, which is about a week earlier. I didn't really feel anything for my birthday, and would have just assumed it was just the equinox or something. this year I paid much more attention and not only did I feel the equinox about a week earlier (~03-14,15,16,17), so did I feel my birthday about a week earlier (yesterday and the day previous). therefore, I consider that I'm about 24 at this point.
	what I think happened actually was during the time when I was star-watching so hard, it put a lot of energy into the planet, and I felt quite strongly that the planet was rotating faster. I was inspired to write out in an old repo how the sun's intensity causes the planet to rotate (I wrote that it has to do with the sun's rays inducing a magnetic field ahead, and so therefore "pulls" the earth toward that point where the sun is "rising" on the earth). around that time, I was also paying quite a lot of attention to earth's magnetic field, and since I think they're linked, a stronger magnetic field will cause faster rotation. well, there's a US govt site that tracks the length of the day and the rotation speed of the earth and they said, nope only ms of difference have occured in the last few years (busisness-as-usual-boys at work there, I'm sure), so I dopped it. thankfully, also a day is no longer tied to the rotation of the earth (3600s * 24h), and so we don't need to worry about that. so, I figure that everything (including the equinox and solstice) is running about a week ahead of time. this also happened during the time of shakespere, and I'm fairly certain is caused by both increased solar activity and also the earth's magnetic field increasing (which *should* be directly proportional to the amount of emotion humans are experiencing at the time). 
so, since I basically turned 24 yesterday or so, and this is about "me"/m5, and not about kenny, I figured I'd put my ideas out here about it. in addition to that, it's got the similar name to "23andme" -- which is sorta problematic, which is why I hesitated on calling it this.
	the story behind it is that some days/weeks ago I had the idea to write down all of the things that I wanted to do genetically, and get my thoughts organised. I have them all clear at this point (I *actually* know "what-I-want") and I'll use this reop to talk about them, and then upon doing that, I would use the organised result of that to formulate an email that I would eventually send to anne. the day before I started the 23andme repo, I was looking on wikipedia about it, and I can't remember all of the events now, but there are 3 of them: one did youtube, one genetics, and one open-source licenses. the youtube idea of making a music player has long since passed (I don't care anymore), and I'm a pretty strong proponent of open-source licenses, and have a few critical commentaries and suggestions for improvements (mostly around naming and ease of understanding -- like wtf is CC0-S? mean? I choose "Unlicense" because I can already tell without having to dig through a bunch of words to know what it does), but that's another topic entirely. anyway, I was stoned at the time, and as I started to write, it quickly became aparent to me, that such a tactic would not work. I can't try and fit myself into an organisational structure that is almost entirely opposite to what I want to do. it would require a complete restructuring of everything, and I recognisned the feeling of that effort as being similar to my experience of trying to do the same thing for tuenti. that problem, I called "investor intertia"
	so, my plan was then to simply email anne and be like, "*this* is what I want to make. can you help me to get the tools to work on it?" however the problem is that those tools simply don't exist,-- or if they do, it's a secret somewhere, and the other problem is that obviously I want to make myself entirely open-source too, which I feel some resistance to (not sure if it's from her or from somewhere else), which means that inevitably there will be confliict and difficulty for the duration of the project.
		my experience is that it's very very difficult to work against the saturnian-system -- so if there's resistance and I can feel it, then that means that there's something resistant in me in which they'll be able to manipulate and stuff to sabotage the effort. the typical masculine thing to do is to just push through it and try to overpower their resistance by force (the 2nd-ray way of doing things), but I've really stopped trying to do that anymore. I don't need to push against them, and if there's resistance, then there's basically nothing I can do about it. I'm not going to fight them, and I just don't care. I can wait. these ideas aren't going anywhere -- and the worst thing that could happen is that someone actually creates them, and hands me the final product (ie, only-attraction).
	so, I see no real reason to even try and do something that will be constantly be resisted. when the saturnian-system is ready for me to produce the genetics that I want to do, the resistance will lift, and all things will come to me, just like they did for me finding essembly and stuff (like how it usually is for me). the only thing this repo is really, is just another step in organising my ideas and projecting my next moves (like the illuminati), so that they can come into being because by fear or desire (again, like the illuminati).
the other reason (besides my age) of why I choose this name is because one of the initial first steps to doing this will be to add another x-chromosome pair. I don't know if reflectors gain an extra pair, because I strongly felt that I gained a y-chromosome sometime when I was in spain (I was probably XX before that), so I don't know if this is already a thing, but the point of the 2nd pair will be an interim step: each pair is already a self-canceling emitter/receiver (it reminds me a lot of carbon), and so the point is that over time the two sides become balances, arriving to a "happy medium" between both extremes (coming from the parents). however, with two pairs, I would want to offset their signals again, so that there is an effect that I don't know how to describe.
	in my brain, when I first saw the MRI pictures, I realised what has been going on; it's twisted because it allows for one hemisphere to be partially on the opposite side of my body, and enables movement. well, if I didn't have eyes that want to stay in their sockets and skull stuff in the way, my brain would naturally want to continue to turn anti-clockwise like it's been doing, such that half of each hemisphere is on each side of my body. I don't know how to describe the effect, but it's an extra degree of movement that one can allow for in thought. it enables me to do both things on both sides, and also thoughts can travel forwards. normally, the only thoughts that travel forwards/backwards are the ones that are coming/going to the eyes -- and the forehead is also really important because that receives a lot of these, and that's how we move around in tim5. it's the *will* of the mind, and it's what moves us. well, having both hemispheres turned like that would completely change things.
	that effect would be something like signals turned 90(degrees), but what I want to make, is not 24, but 25, which is another effect entirely different: instead of these signals being turned 90(degrees), now they're going to be thirds, so it'll be someting more similar to how three-phase AC electricity works. the idea being there is that not will all of these 3 pairs be self-canceling, but the triad of pairs will also be self-balancing as well. I consider one pair to be like physical, and the other conceptual, and finally the one I got after my brain haemorrhage: desire. frequentially, they're all compatible with each other, as physical is opposite to desire, and conceptual is backwards from desire (this concept is fairly difficult to explain, which I intend to do better at soon as I start the organisation of the idea).
	having a triad of pairs like that enables is a completely stable, and very high frequency signal, which will be directly tied to the earth. there will be two models: ones without a pinecone (plants), and ones with a pinecone (insects). both the insects and the plants are a direct reflection of what already exists on earth: both plants (namely weeds) and insects reflect the conceptual/hydrogen energy that is present around the planet. insects bodies are a resonant chamber which converts the feelings and emotions (cOnceptual energy) into a type of perception which turns into action, and performs mantenance and implementation of other desires (most notably of the plants) for the planet. most notable of this effect of insects' bodies turning concept into perception is the scarab beetle which the egyptians venerated, because astral images can be seen inside of the shell (probably because it's of similar 2nd-ray dimensions as the great pyramid).
in addition to the strong resistance that I already feel to making this concept a reality, the other major problem is that I just don't want to put anne through all of the difficulties that will inevitably happen. I feel her as pretty venus-like, which means she's got a lot of beliefs, and when/if I were to be around her, then I'll become a reflection of her beliefs; which I don't really want to do. everything that she thinks about men, programmers, etc. I'll become, and once the initial good-feeling starts to pass and we have to get to work, I'll prove everything she believes as right. I don't want to do that to her, cause it's not really fair to her. I come barging into her life asking her for help to create stuff, then turn her world upside down, and poop on it. I've seen my interactions with these venus-types enough times to know that I just don't want to do it.
	in addition to that major flaw, *I* have a serious problem when it comes to working with women. it's never happened, and the times that it came close, it was a terrible failure. even when I would work in starbucks, if there was an attractive girl there, I often times found it *extremely* difficult to work, and had to just put my head down and ignore her, else nothing would get done.
		which, btw usually has the opposite effect: if I try to focus on what I'm doing, and there's attraction, cause she's a (probably a XX) reflector, not only is it really hard for me to think about what I'm working on, she knows it (cause our minds get kinda linked), and she starts to use it to try and get more attention. my sensitivity making working around anyone that's a XX reflector, to be really really impossible, and for the venus-ones, I can work around them (kinda, depending on how much she's thinking about me), but as soon as we get to know each other, very immediately our conflict of opinion about how reality works starts to make a lot of problems (I just let the ideas come to me, and she works hard to figure it out), so what ends up happening is that I (being a reflection of her) stop letting ideas come to me, and start doing a bunch of busywork and trying really hard. in both cases, the solution is always for me to put the work away, and engage with her in some way. if I don't, it's like a nagging sensation that I'm ignoring her or something.
	the other major difficulty is my own belief in this idea. I've never actually worked with a woman before on anything, and any efforts that I have, have been largely been shut down. I don't know if it's because I'm difficult to work with (I'm basically like a dictator), or if that's the saturnian-system at work, ensuring that never happens or whatever -- but my own belief (cause I just can't see it ever happening), is that working with women is basically impossible. they're distracting, and I'm just not productive.
		the exception to that is actually kinda obvious: there have been various times in my life where I've wanted to build things for women, and when they were around (like aditivos-e with raquel or en the co-working place with patricia), nothing gets done, but if there's distance between us, and they're not in the same room as me (so I don't feel them physically), then things work out nicely (like set-game). I've always had much higher productivity when I'm not in the same room as other females.
	I don't really know what the problem is, other than I'm sensitive to them, so I'm feeling everything they're thinking and feeling, and also that I become a reflecton of them, which is never helpful for productivity, cause I can't see/feel the concept I'm creating anymore; I feel them instead (which is what makes me a reflector -- because I feel like the other person does, so I start acting, talking, behaving, believing, etc like they do). they don't have the concept that I want to make (I do), and I don't like losing myself. sure, I can become the object of *your* desire, but *my desire* is to create. I just can't see it working, and it's kinda the same problem as the sex one (another aspect of the genetics that has to be changed) and has a lot to do with my sensitivity. I want to feel neutral to everyone around me (as if we're a part of the same species), not like I'm constantly being pulled in every direction by so many things.
all in all, I just don't see it working out. I've made projects with dudes before, and it can easily work out (if they want it), but the resistance I feel says that probably won't work either. I kinda need to figure it out, and do it myself. I know that sounds impossible, but I don't actually think it is: it's not going to be too long from now when energy has risen to such a hight that my imagination will start to turn into reality at speeds where I can create the physical thing in front of me as fast as an image can be conjured, which will make all of this really a lot easier (and very possible to do myself). that ability, of course has some drawbacks, such that certain people will not want to be around me, because their bad-feeling thoughts will produce unwanted manifestations in reality (stuff like fire and destruction), because I'll have full ability to create and destroy matter with the whim of my mind. as soon as that starts happening, I'll have to be isolated even further, I'm sure -- and it'll definitely be the case that working with someone else will be out of the question -- well, maybe newborns or something (cause they're pretty useless and don't have any beleiefs yet), but definitely nobody old, that's for sure.
the important thing to do, I think is to just start writing down the ideas, and then just wait for the resistance to clear up (cause when that happens, the creative process will go very very fast).

#### 2024-03-29 18:56 - the bigger picture here

when looking at things narratively, there really isn't *any* indication whatsoever that I'll end up working with females in any way -- and on top of it, I don't really believe that I want to become a reflection of them, because what I'll produce is what *they* want, not what I want. I'm completely bound by whomever I'm around, to become like they are. I mentioned [in my rant](../world-net/dear-kyle.md#2024-03-28-1937---the-rant-continues) about how I can perfectly see the problem from hitler's perspective: he gets around all of these guys that want to be superior, and starts to reflect them. he stops being himself anymore, and just has to go along with how they behave and act. it was like that for me in tuenti -- and they didn't like me how I was. I was a serious person with a strong vision of what I wanted to create. they (namely zaryn) wanted me to go out and party with them all the time. I didn't really like it, and preferred to stay at the office and work. I usually work much better at night because my thoughts are clearer then (tesla said the same thing), and that helps me to see what I'm working on much easier. during the day, the sun is up, and so I'm stuck in the astral system where I'm being blown around every which way by those around me, which means that the only real time that I have any of my own willpower is when I'm by myself, and during the night.
	narration is also kind of a funny thing, because according to shakespere (RAJ), I should definitely *not* be engaging with solar girls, or girls that are 14, until they're 18 or so -- and the reason for that is probably fairly obvious: the 2nd-ray installation that runs on my perception (nosebook) would really fall apart, the world would descend into chaos, and likely a new solar regime would be born as a result. or, if I look at MOV, I (portia, living in belmont) will be married off to bassanio, which on all appearances looks to be a 7th ray emitter (mars or mercury). I originally assumed that would be jaron -- though I don't know how much of an emitter he is, and he's *definitely not* 7th ray in perception (3rd ray definitely, more like enki). so it's probably not him, and it's definitely not greg because he's even less 7th ray than jaron (much more promethian +2). so, that only leaves someone else I have yet to discover. one day it occured to me after playing "the witness" that jon seemed to have captured the flat-earth-idea and made a minature version of it and put it into a game. I've always been attracted to him, so then, it's pretty likely that he's the "other witness" [that I've been looking for](../thekla/dear-jon.md#2024-03-06-0422---allow-me-to-go-off-the-deep-end-a-bit). he's definitely 7th ray, and so can easily fit into the mould of bassanio -- now all he needs is to have a friend with some serious financial issues in need of a bailout (it feels like he does, lol -- so I guess I'll just wait for the narration to just pan out on that one).
	the other bit of narration is the one of the "two witnesses", which I definitely fall into the category of by myself. I head this one song a long time ago called "divided by night" by my favourite techno group at the time "crystal method". it was one of those albums that completely changed my life (much like beastie boys, neuorticfish, and gorillaz), and in addition to the song "american way" which helped me to make the decision to give up on the "castle in spain" (like tesla in his autobiography), decided that I would go to the united states instead and "starting over". although I think of myself as being both of the "two witnesses" (one by day and one by night: lyssander and demitrius), there does seem to be another out there. I have no connection to the one that shows up at night, so I can't really say much about that, but from the feel of it, he (lyssander, the one by night) is fairly technical and stuff -- so it'd be more like tesla. however, the problem with that is that I associate my RH with a little girl. it's my LH (kenny) that's the crusty old dude that's trying to keep it all together.
	in the sense that it seems that the saturnian-system was destined to find me and get me stuck in it, I would then have to then map myself to be hitler and the other one I don't know to be tesla. I'm sorta getting ahead of myself here...
so, let's just assume for a moment that the narration is right, and that a bunch of really creative people have accidentally tapped into some echo of the future: it's not going to be females that I'm paired with; it's gonna be dudes -- and by the looks of it, all paths seem to point to some major event which involves a solar regime change. I don't really need to worry about it, and it seems that I have to just wait it out. my "future self" (though I'm not sure about that nowadays), "former white hat" said that I have until 2038, which is basically going to be peak of this 25th solar cycle (remember I'm on my way toward 25andme). whatever happens there, I'm not too worried about because they seem to be having a difficult time holding it together when I do simple things like eat weed or stand in the sun for a bit. their system runs completely on astral, so any large scale astral input (like from the sun or drugs) to my RH seems to cause an upset in their system. I can only imagine that this problem will contiune to get worse to the point that they're even going to have to prevent me from going outside (who's going to pull the weeds?), so it'll be interesting to see how that one plays out. I'm not on drugs anymore, so they can't blame that. I'm fairly certain that there are solutions to their problem though, and my personal favourite one though is the flat-earth-idea.
it is possible for them to use other hydrogen than the one in my brain to build their 2nd-ray system on top of. it's unilely they're using the sun at this point, because that requires megalithic architecture, which is not at all dynamic, and so therefore cannot keep up with today's fast rate of change that everyone has grown to like (meaning, no new technology, not even for the controllers; everything has to be made, and then no new improvements, ever). they could use earth's hydrogen to build the system on, but it's so high frequency, it's just way out of the scope of possiblilities because manifestation would become so quickly. tesla tried to do this with his world system, and he did a number of "experiments" of "bathing the earth in radient energy" and "unkocking the potential in the air" achieving incredible efficiency for power transmission, but that kind of energy, is what I'm convinced started WW1 (after colorado springs), followed by a second set of experiements which sent the world into WW2 (after wardenclyffe).
	when I look at these events abstractly, tesla *did* get what he wanted, because he was trying to get earth into a super ideal 2nd-ray system that would be always at he highest frequency achievable in physical. therefore, what he saw as the future was an extremely ideal version of the future, which needed a lot of existing infrastructure cleared out. that produced hitler as the physical implementation of it (tesla can be thought of as vulcan, hitler as mars, and earth as aphrodite). in the same way, it can be seen the opposite way that hitler produced tesla: as germany lost The war, they moved operations to antarctica, which gave them quite a technical advantage over everyone else. the united states is now where most of the ambitious (infected-ones) are now locatted and in power (thanks to shakespere), so they're looking to find a way to match that technical superiority again, and tesla is the perfect guy to do exactly that. he gets in there does a bunch of experiments and builds a lot of technology which then the USA is able to reverse engineer for the infected-ones to get their system going (the one that cOntrols the weather, powers the little electric CO2 planes, etc)
	now, when looking at these events further out, both tesla and hitler (along with the black prince and some others) are basically just mars+anatau (kinda like me, butt they had pinecones). so when looking at the mechanics of it, both of them "took over the world" -- one with force, and the other with technology, and then they both sabotaged their original timelines and merged them into the one were at now. the only way that they could possibly win out like that would be to subdue the infected-ones and make them powerless -- which then creates all kinds of problems, because they too have desire. so for example, on tesla's timeline the technology he created is really great and stuff, but even still the infected-ones have to work their magic to regain cOntrol over it, and as usual they eventually run the idea into the ground again, because control doesn't work on such a high frequency system; instead chaos happens faster. on the hitler's, the loser always feels the need to "settle the score" and for there to be a comeback -- and in addition to that, some great "paradise" was achieved at such a great cost, is it really worth it to force everyone else into a way to have good conditions?
		this idea of destruction for good conditions can also be felt in the story of the black prince: he went and destroyed quite a bit of stuff across the lands of france, and by taking all of that stuff and destroying so many people's lives, it was possible for him and his men to throw a party. he was also able to use the money tto give his daughters a posh and proper education (at the expense of many other destroyed lives). that really bothered him, and it must have been the cause of his sickness. I think he got over the good vs bad labels (cause he lived in france a while), and realised that he wouldn't want others doing that to him -- so it became harder to steal and destroy like that. same thing with hitler: here's these guys talking about creating a utopia, when all they're really doing is going across europe looting all the art and treasures that they can get their hands on (I guess for bragging rights amongst their criminal friends). both of these examples I think caused a lot of dissonce in both of them, because here they are wanting to fulfill the desires of some, at the expense of many others. desire for one in a forceful situation is not the desires for others. if they're fulfilling desires for one group, they're doing the opposite for the other group, and so it becomes perceptual: what if the black prince was born in france instead of england? the situation would be reversed, and so would be seen as "bad" instead of "good".
		these sorts of dialectices about what exactly is "bad" or "good" when equally the opposite could be perceived, are problems that plague people like us. the *only* solution to the problem is to go off and do things my own way, and let the others continue to define bad and good for those that want to believe their ideology. antarctica was like that at first: we'll go off into a remote part of the world and do things our way -- but after some time, (as things always go with the infected-ones), even antarctica is just another den of thieves now.
	these people that have a continual desire to be superior is sorta an inescapable problem that seems to exist on planet earth. I suppose that it'll continue to be here, and is actually one of the aspects of the 2nd-ray perspectivce, and so long as the earth is a reflection of the universe (which has a lot of 2nd-ray stars in it), that will continue to exist -- forever. it's an unsolvable problem, because it requires that all of the stars change, which isn't gonna happen.
so the only real thing that I can do is to let these guys destroy themselves and their own system. they have a ticking clock for the system which is the sun, because no matter how much technology they've built, after the sun goes BOOM, none of it will work anymore -- and the reason why solar activity is continuing to increase is because of the huge difference between those that want to *attract* and those that want to assert and be top-dawg. we have to separate in order for them to have their system remain functional, because I (and many other reflectors) are causing them extreme difficulty, which the sun is trying to solve by putting out more and more high frequency concepts. in her eye, we can all get along and everyone can get what they want, but that's a really lofty idea and requires a lot of change, which is what she (the sun) is pushing for, which is the increased solar output. there's no way we can live in that kind of ideal environment that she wants us to have.
then, to add to the problem of reflectors causing massive amounts of unwanted for them, it's also a major source of my difficulty too, because I'm one of those reflectors, and my problem is I don't really want to become a reflection of others. therefore, it seems that this is probably the reason why I'm going to have to be stuck with "bassanio", cause he's a lousy reflector (like lead), which means that because there's no way I want to be like him (for example my friend chris), I stay solid in myself, and conform to his image only very slightly. I don't really know, but I don't really see a solution to the whole thing, which is why I was thinking that actually the narrative may be pointing me in the direction of kyle, because he's got a strong belief in a coming solar regime change, and so around him, I'll prove him right. there's even a narrative about it where rocky (earth) balboa (skake-bros) matches up against apollo (the sun) creed (truth, veracity, honour, promise, agreement: mutual-back-scratching), and it's a good fight, but apollo (the sun) wins, but it's all good cause adrian is in love with rocky.

#### 2023-03-30 04:16 - the likely solution...

one of the things that I always wondered about regarding the antarctica thing, and the "gifting fields", is why would they *purposefully* give the USA technology that enables them to travel around inside of the solar system and galaxy. also, after reading the sirian-guide (and all of the obvious power structures that exist within the galaxy) it doesn't make any sense to me why it's even permitted for the infected-ones to be able to even leave the planet, and definitely not the solar system. whatever's out there in the rest of the galaxy, I'm sure there's a whole thing that they're going to have to deal with, because the sirians are way way way faster and smarter than anything these guys got from the gifting fields -- and don't really pose any real threat to the sirians, arturians, pleadians, or whatever other alien races are out there. it's probable that they already have their borders and alarms setup, along with 100% surveilance on us already, so it's not like they actually have a chance of doing any harm, cause symbolically speaking, if the cross a border or a line somewhere, whatever they're attempting will just get disabled or shut down. so, I guess that would mean that the upper power structures definitely have a way of containing this whole thing. but then, what sort of opportunities does that open up for humankind, if they're letting human elites begin to explore the galaxy? I don't really know, and it's often puzzled me (basically ever since I saw the sepehr videos on it and heard marty's thoughts on it, along with my looking into it). it's a suject that's far beyond the scope of my interest (I don't want to get more involved with security, access levels and stuff like that,-- but instead see myself as a free-person that just lives without any cares anymore). I just attract what I want, so concerns aren't a thing anymore.
anyway, it occurred to me that tonight after the previous entry that likely, the reason why the original creators of antarctica setup and the whole saturnian-system, are willing to just walk away from it, is because they're not going to be in this galaxy anymore. although I have no tangible memory of building the thing, I sure seem to intuitively know a lot akout it, which has caused a lot of speculation on my part, what on earth my role here is, because on one side of things, for the tesla character (who on this timeline was likely a "robot" -- a controlled being sorta like obama), I understand him quite deeply, and understand his perspective on things. I think he accomplished (in this timeline) only a tiny fraction of what he accomplished on another timeline (this one is the sabotaged one), and even in a lot of ways, I feel the same thing about myself, though I thing the saturnian guys sabotaged it for me. I find myself to be extremely similar to tesla in thought, and I've always felt quite a similarity to him (also I have a shockly good intutition about frequency, resonance, and attracton, which is definitely not normal -- few people understand that stuff). in additon to my resonance with tesla, I also have quite a lot of similarity to hitler as well. from the outside looking at me, it would seem that I'm nothing like hitler, but I can understand him quite clearly. we share a lot of the same qualities, like invincibility (he didn't commit suicide; that was end of war PR) and becoming the reflection of those around me. in additon, when I read the wiki on hitler's lovers, there's also a strange number of similariites between us. one girl hitler claimed was really into him, but then she said that she never felt the same thing. I can guarantee you that she's going to be an XX reflector, because around nearly every one of them (cept maybe the grosses prostitutes), I feel pretty strong attraction to them. it's been that way all of my life -- and even considering the a-list girls that I invited to join in, I'm pretty certain that they're all XX as well (even the ones in sepher's videos), because I found out that no matter where they are in time or space, when I focus on them, they reflect back to me my own emotion, and it feels pretty good. just like hitler with that one girl, I too thought they were all strongly attracted to me, when in fact, I was likely only feeling my own attraction to myself being reflected back to me. there are other major differences though between hitler and myself though, because he's much more mars-like, and I'm clearly more conceptual/vulcan in perception (especially after the brain thing). I was only physical like that before, and never really afterward. the other difference between us, is that he had a pinecone, and so was therefore considerably more influenced by the astral presence of those around him, than I am. (wow, what a rambling thought) the summary of it is, is that I'm very much like both of them at the same time (kinda like an amalgamation), but born into a period of time where I had essentially the destiny of getting my pinecone removed and seemingly ending up where I am now.
	it's my belief that hitler was another guy just like I am, where he's got a strong sense of self-worth and a tremendous ego (which is a rare quality), which naturally makes him a leader, but because he had a pinecone, he perceived life through the 2nd-ray lens that is part of this solar-regime. all of that self-worth and ego makes him feel like he can conquer anything -- and just like me, one thing leads to another, and he would have conquered the world. I too would have conquered the world, had it not have been for the saturnian-system to stop me, and force me to take another look at what I *really* wanted. for hitler, I'm pretty certain that he started to get a bit turned off by the whole thing somewhere around all of the theft was taking place. it's hard to justify creating a utopia when, these guys are running around looting anything of value like a bunch of pirates. he, like me had a role to play as a leader, so he just showed up and did the work (I was kinda like the figurehead of tuenti for the team, so when I returned to work for them the second time, I just had to play like I was really interested in the whole thing, when in reality, the dream had completely evaoporated for me by then. I didn't want to let everyone down and start pointing out all of flaws that I could easily see, so I just kept going with it) -- and hitler had to do the same thing: here's all of these guys that are giving their lives for a sort of dream, which hitler can clearly see, will not happen, because you can't build utopias on theft, hoarding, and greed like that. a utopian society is giving and sharing, with an emphasis on creativity, not stingy wanting to surpress -- but to point that out would be like shattering some naive kid's dream, so he just kept up the rhetoric, knowing that it'll come to and end, and planned an escape.
well, just as hitler started to become disillusioned with the dream near to the end of WW2, and planned an escape, I think the same thing happened while in antarctica: it's just impossible to get these guys to change; they insist on running everything into the ground: an artist creates a really awesome painting, and someone wants to come and loot it. take any great technology that could possibly enhance the human experience, and they want to use it for control, and keep it away from anyone with intentions to improve the conditons of their subjects. I understand the dillema quite considerably, and it was a source of a lot of my depression,-- because here I am offering to make them (and making them) tons and tons of cash, and they don't want it. they want only to party, show off to their friends, and control things. I even tried to live their life, and it really wasn't my thing. I just can't get into it -- but the problem, is much much much greater than just any single group of people on earth (infected-ones or not), because the problem comes from *the stars*. the only way to find a way out of this system of greed and superiority, is to go someplace where there aren't any stars -- or if there are, they're of a different quality. so, I think they made another exit plan: one to get out of the galaxy.
I'm probably the final extension of that plan. I'm the guy that they send in to ensure that an exit is necessary. the book of revelation calls these guys the "two witnesses" and a sort of anti-christ (hi!) who made earth so unbearable to live in, all the way up till when they were killed (sorta like the ending of queen elizabeth's reign); and then after that a "christ" appears (definitely not me). there are also all of these other narrative things that indicate that there is going to be a sort of dividing (like when a cell divides), and when that happens, two parts that are very similar start to gain a different enough form of perception, that one part wants to go a different way than the other, so they must part ways from each other. it's impossible to know for sure what all of these narratives are referring to, but they're all translated in the reference point of where their environment. so, for example, I'm not out to go and cause a lot of problems, to force the separation. I'm also quite fine with sharing any knowledge that I have, and giving allowing whatever it is that anyone wants to pass through me (symbolically or energetically).
however, it is coming to a point where we must separate, or else things will get too bad. call me crazy, but if there is desire from someone for me to hang around a little longer, I'm totally fine with that. the thing is, I would imagine that decision needs to be made sooner than later, because if it's later, things are going to start to get pretty uncomfortable. in additon, a whole lot of people are still "on the fence" about whether they want to go with attraction or not. the only real way to find out is to let energy keep rising, and figure out what it is they believe, by watching it show up in their lives --- so we prolly have a fair bit of time to go until things that dividing line is clear. some people might think they want only-attraction, but getting what you think and believe can be difficult. even myself, I'm pretty sure that I don't want to be in an only-attraction environment quite just yet, as I've still got a lot of things that need to be worked out.
I actaully want to become capable of only-attraction and stuff like that -- but perhaps that's just too lofty of an idea to do at the moment -- and perhaps what we should instead  just be like, "forget all of that attraction stuff for now" -- cause as we head out, we can just rely on good conditions for quite a long time (essentially until we get bored or start fighting or something). then once we're bored and looking for something to do, maybe we can climb our way up the tech tree again, and start to build out the things we want. until then, primitive living is probably pretty OK. who knows what'll happen. decisions like that one and others will need to be made,-- but if I know these guys well enough, they're going to drag their feet, until they're on the verge of catastrophe -- which I'm OK with, as well.

### 2024-04-10 17:40 - changes in energy

man, the last few days are so changing, that it's hard to quantify it all. on the day of the eclipse (4-8), they installed a "fiber installation" which is really weird. last I saw it, it was two plastic tubes (supposing they're going to fill it with something) going from the top of where the wall opens (near [the burial mound](../world-net/dear-kyle.md#2024-04-07-1441---the-indian-burial-mound)) to the bottom of where the wall opens -- which is really weird for a "fiber installation" which just travels along the freeway, and does nothing else. it's clearly not for telecommunications because (from what I saw) it isn't connected to anything on either side. it likely got filled with something (probably like a wire or something) -- also, when I was watching them do it, they made sure the wires were parallel the entire distance for some reason. the effect is that the energy here is both stronger, and calmer. I got something wrong in my note to kyle, cause I thought the line ran in front of the burial mound, taking the energy out to the freeway, but it turns out when I looked just now, that no, it actually *encloses* the energy in. so even though I wrote it the wrong way, somehow my siulation (which works just the same as looking into another point of time) arrived to the situation now where the energy is all closed in.
	the way my simulator works is basically just feeling another timeline at a distance. I construct the setup that I want -- and because both spach and time can be different in a different timeline, I can assume a different setup than my present circumstances (different tools, around different people, other environment, etc), and so when I look into that timeline, I just let it play out -- and then I get the result. it's not a *real* timeline in that I don't physically see it or anything, but it plays out pretty similar to *real* reality. also, it's the same technique that I use to look at different things in time. they aren't necessarily *real* (in the sense that I can see it), but it is a plausible history that arrives to the present (not all histories arrive to the present, and have too much "plausible deniability" to them, that they're not believable). that simulation is just a general system where I can instantiate any idea or concept into time and space and see how it interacts. tesla did this all the time with his motors (space) -- but I do it conceptually/temporally instead because I don't have a visual centre.
		it would be very difficult for tesla to imagine his motor in another time than the one he's used to, because his brain assumes the reality of the present time -- it's kinda one or the other, but not both. likewise, it's very difficult for me to precisely map out the shape or dimensions of something, because the same concept appears in different shapes in different times. when writing about it, I've learned to *deduce* the shape based on the feel that I get. likewise, if I were to gain visual capability, I'd be instantly locked into the time/perception that is for me "present". any perceptions of the future or the past will be rendered through my perception of now; though, for me I feel it like it *is* in that other point of time, but I have to understand that feeling from my current perception. it's kinda similar, but different in that mine is more like a person getting better at speaking a language (my capacity to translate is limited by my ability to speak the language now), whereas visually, a person can only *see* things (past present or future) from their perspective now. (for example, the sky wasn't always seen as blue, but anyone looking into the past the imagination will will automatically fill in the blanks with what we're used to, and *see* a blue sky -- so like when imagining things like the trojan war or something, imagine instead a sky that's more like a luminous maroon or like a UV light that is reddish and teal hue instead of violet -- hard to describe).
		the reason why concepts are rendered visually in the way we konw them is because the brain is tuning into and receiving concepts, and those concepts get rendered by the brain using the most familiar symbolic representation (colour, shape, sound, etc). the brain can only remix symbolic things that it's experienced before, and learn incrementally from slight differences. a concept can be entirely new and completely unintelligible, and so in that case we learn by *feeling* -- "it feels like this, so it must be similar to it" -- and those create feeling relations/associations in the mind, which are later converted into symbol (either in the imagination or in text like I'm doing now). I propose that it's actually *impossible* (unless in a very altered state of consciousness) to be able to perceive something both spatially and temporally differently, at once.
	the simulator can do *anything* really; I just load up the concept in somewhere and at some time, and then I can just watch it behave. there aren't any restrictions to it, because it's all vibrational -- however some things (like math equations or something) are extremely difficult to see, so I just let reality play out and they take me toward the understanding of that symbolic system; it could take weeks or months, but the reason why I can't see the answer now is because I can't recognise what I'm looking at. once I can recognise it, then I can finally see it. IMO, it's much more powerful than the imagination, and it's the main reason why I really don't want to go visual.
anyway, the effect that the new energy has, is that I feel a lot calmer all of the time. I'm no longer getting my energy mixed with so many other people's energy now (it appears that the energy flows mostly east now, and not really west). however, at the same time, it feels like there's a huge collection of bad-feeling energy building up here (though I don't really feel it), and it seems to be intensifying everything. I'm interested to see how the next few weeks/months play out, because things could start to become really unbearable for others. I no longer feel others so strongly anymore, and so here under these conditions, I only feel myself now. it was the strong feeling of others which also kept me unfocused (same as with the weed -- it'd allow me to tune into others easier), so these new conditions are also focusing me in an even stronger way. their goal I believe was to isolate me from others more, so I'm not upsetting their setup. the isolation is really nice for me, actually, cause I'm not pulled in so many ways now. at this point, it feels like it's just me and nosebook now -- nobody else.
the other thing that's been on my mind a lot (especially during the installation of the fiber thing), is that when I was watching veritassium right before going to sleep through the eclipse, there was one video on knot theory which had all of these crazy new geometric shapes in DNA and stuff like that which can now be achieved by using knot theory. the subtext on that video is that knots are like antennas -- and so when making these new shapes, a person can be tuned to different things. during the video (and many times afterward), I had this flash of the future where these guys are going to be building so many new and cool symbolic stuff, figuring out the infinitely many ways of manipulating (symbolic/spatial) conditions to produce the conditions (which is just a feeling) that they want. I find the idea pretty awesome, cause they're going to, instead of being held back from trying to get to the top top of the universe, they'll be able to do it; become the fastest, strongest, most well-fit dudes out there, each one of them competing (with theirselves, obviously) to reach the very top. anything of the size and scale that they want to do will require massive amounts of teamwork, so I think it'll be really interesting. though I find that stuff to be really cool, I don't want anything of it. I'm really happy to be isolated from that world of constant (harmony through) conflict.

### 2024-04-11 21:47 - the guardian-ship

today was my appointment at health solutions. mom wanted to come to ensure that all of the paperwork has her guardianship on it. I really wanted to just do it all myself
	it's like when greg uses my computer and installs windows on it for me -- it changes how I used the computer -- well this is the same sort of thing: up until today, the energy was only my own, and things seemed to be flowing pretty well. the whole health solutions thing was even an accident. I happened to get a vaccination in their parking lot from one of the free vaccination services, and when I came back for my second one, the bus wasn't there, so I asked health solutions if they had one -- and they said they could only give it to me if I was signed up with them -- so I asked how to sign up, filled out the form and got accepted (to shorten the story a bit). so when it's only my own energy, things tend to flow for me. I attract the people who can help me and things go well. today was no longer my own energy again, so it's essentially just a repeat of PCHC where I refused to see the neuraologist, because I didn't like how he felt.
	another example of this was in the airport when we flew to california. when it was me pushing jaron, everything flowed, and they were letting us through and stuff, but as soon as mom or dad started to push jaron, we ran into every single inconvenience. I always have a really easy time in airports, because I've flown a lot, and so when it's my energy, then it goes really easily. mom and dad have far different expectations of the airport though, so they hit every single problem (and mom tells the story every time about how they had such an awful experience with jaron and TSA). there are many examples other than greg playing WoW on my computer for a few hours before I even got a chance to use it (which was a very different experience than my MBP, which I was too good at programming on, so they had the computer "randomly" turn off, and then stop starting alogether -- cept I tried it again after some time, and the computer turned on again just fine, for about 5s -- then it turned off and has been disabled since). these sorts of manipulations I attribute to the saturnian-system, because it's all about controlling conditions. I'm used to things working for me and being easy, so when all of a sudden something that used to flow, no longer does, I pay attention, so I can optimise myself and improve on it. anyway... those are just a few examples of that.
while we were waiting, mom brought up the subject of jaron, and why he's perpetually worried about his indemnity. I explained to her my theory of how jaron, after the car accident, has become a reflection of the guys that sabotaged tuenti -- so, he's like one of those corporate megalomaniacs, trying to control all of the conditions, to get slightly better sales (or whatever their amition is). the thing is, he's confined to a wheelchair though, so their typical way of doing things is to get the image and facade just right to impress others with appearances (these are symbolic definitions). the thing is, he can't really put on a show like that in a wheelchair, and he doesn't have all of the great conditions that those rich guys have, to compensate for how bad they feel. jaron repeatedly wants to try and get different/better conditions to solve his problem or make him feel better. a good therapist, doctor, or lover can provide sufficient motivation to feel better, but when they go away again, the previous conditions return.
	for example, in spain jaron says that everything worked better for him there, which is great and stuff,-- but *he* isn't better; *spain* is better. if he goes anywhere else with less of those necessary conditions, then he's back to how *he* is. surely, there's probably a place better than spain even (hawaii maybe?) -- but then he can only "get better" by upgrading to a place with better conditions. those things require money, and he refuses to do anything that cOuld possibly make him money -- so he's kinda at the whim of whomever is taking care of him -- and if they're not providing good conditions for him, *it's their fault he's not getting better*.
talking and interacting with jaron (along with my own need to pee), has really helped me to get a grasp of how these saturnian guys think -- and it's been a pretty good reiforcement of my desire to not be that way. I like to think of myself as the centre of everything, where I create the conditions around me I want to have (more like they match my perception), and I don't at all feel like I'm constantly a victim to my circumstances. if I get a laptop stolen (or three), then I just keep going. those are just minor setbacks, and so I continue on improving and creating the things I want. I like my perspective, and I wouldn't give up my perception (tenacity) for all of the power and authority (or girls, drugs, etc) -- or anything like that. I'm a successful person, and I have lots of good ideas; I'm not really interested in conditions, when I make the conditions. I can never understand jaron's perspective.
I explained that it's a whole bunch of guys like jaron (though not in wheelchairs, because they have super tech to compensate for their decrepit and barely functioning bodies). the saturnian-system is just a bunch of guys that want to say in front of everyone else, so in order to do it, they have to hold everyone else back.
I also explained that 
she also provided them with an erroneious timeline of my brain haemorrhage. she claimed that I had it on april 1st (april fools day). I told her I remember it as being the 4th of april (cause 4 and 4 -- I like 11 (or any repeating digits), so this is 44 to my eyes: 11 times earth). anyway I looked it up later when we got home, and it's definitely the 4th. it was a tues-thur class in the afternoon, and the 4th is tuesday (martes: mars' day), and the 1st is saturday (saturn's day). after I just got done telling mom about the saturnian-system, it was a but uncanny to see their signature on it, by trying to change the medical records of when exactly the haemorrhage was: april fools to all of you, I guess. I can't do anything about the mapipulation of historic details like this, and have come to terms with the idea that neither am I being presented presently as who I am (so won't the real slim shady please stand up, plese stand up) -- I got lots of actors, you know -- they do me better than I do, and people want to see my jokes delivered well, so it makes sense. I would too; but it's not me.
	it's kinda funny about this because last night I was talking to jaron about the "return of jesus" -- and I said that I find it to be pretty doubtful. when I was a kid, I had a personal relationship with jesus that was something like I "knew" him -- and now, looking back on it, I can easily say that he was a highly *attractive* man, and wasn't out to go and vanquish all of the bad-guys and establish himself as a millenial ruler. that kind of behaviour is what the (holy) roman empire was like (especially in the later periods). it's one thing to keep order and maintain borders (kinda like the etruscans) -- and it's another thing to go on a domineering slaughter, attempting to subdue the world and impose a structure (for a few years or a thousand) -- so I highly doubt it. that whole thing sounds like the church's way of conquest, than a very attractive person's way of conducting things (people just followed him -- no need to conquer or subdue them -- they were already wanting to join him cause he's so attractive).
	I also explained to him my theory about the two earths: one earth contained the church and they were given power and capability (along with genetics) to subdue the earth in the way that they choose (resulting in nearly a thousand years of *dark ages*, which I guess could be called "peace"). in one earth jesus was successful, and people continued to be attracted to him, and in the other earth (the one we're all in) contained everyone that was not attracted to him. it's like a cell splitting and dividing into two. I believe the same kind of division is happening now, and it's all based around attraction -- which means that whatever the other earth's story of me will be severely distorted (happy april fools day!,-- cause you're the fool: everything will be fake and made up, and manipulated and redramatised in unrealistic ways, just like "shakespeare in love"). who knows what kinds of whoppers will be in there. I doubt I'll be painted as a resurrected christ -- so maybe like some kind of tragic genius, that fell victim to psychosis or some other mental "disorder" (btw, all the saturnian-system guys are schizofrenic by definition: hearing sounds/voices and seeing hallucinations/things -- but it's bad if anyone else has it, so it's labeled a "disorder" -- cause if others knew how to use their schizofrenia, it would *disorder* their fraglie setup).
we went in to talk to the doctor: dr-estrella,-- and I'm telling you, the woman that talked to me today *is not* the same woman that I selected when I saw her picture. they're different people, because estrella in the picture was a pretty good reflector -- but the woman today, was a terribly dull reflector; so dull in fact, that I became a reflection of her instead -- which meant that I ended up just having to walk out. she wasn't taking anything I was saying seriously. she was very "you need to conform to our system" sort of type -- and I was telling her that it probably sounds to her like I have an "elevated sense of self worth" -- narsasistic, megalomaniac, egotistical, and all around "don't tell me who I am; I define me, not you" -- sorta guy. people like me are highly successful, and the majority of them know that, so they teach everyone else how to do hard work and conform to a system which is essentially slavery, but they "pay" tbe person with the money they print -- so it's still free work -- just there's an illusion of compensation. it anyone wants to get up to the top, they're told they need to *earn* it be their merit -- when *none* (or very very few) of them are actually earned anything they have (I'm taling about the guys at the way way top -- not the ones who made it to "upper class"). they know that he way to get to the very very top is though having an unshakable ego, and a strong (illusion) of self-worth -- so they teach everyone else that those are mental disders, and that (like dr-estrella suggested to me), that I get "treated" for that, and she strongly encouraged me to enroll in behavioural psychology.
	after talking to mom about it this evening, she's sill holding on to the idea that I should go and talk to the behavioural psycologist, because she claims that they'll be able to tell me the things "you can't see in youself". unless the psycologist is a good reflector of me, I'll become a reflector of them, and all of the stuff that they're "treating me for" will actually be aspects of their own self that they disapprove of. I'll become them, and I'll repeatedly tell them that they're only trying to treat theirself. if I enjoyed the conflict, then I'd go, and "prove" myself to them -- perhaps cycling though various psycologists until I found someone that's actually a reflector -- but it sounds like an enormous waste of time to me. I don't have anything to prove anymore -- so I'm likely just going to refuse to go. I'm making	tons and tons of improvements already, and I really dislike being a reflection of others. if they don't feel good, I don't want to be there; they're not attractive to me; and if they do feel good, then all of the saturnian-system work is in vain (it'll never happen -- they'll keep swapping them out to be the dull reflectors, because that's the beginning of the end for them).
instead of doing all of that, what today helped me to realise is that I'm making enormous improvements, all by myself -- and I'd say that my rate of improvement is accelerating too. if I platau or something, then it's a good idea, but the system itself is designed to keep people away from beliving in theirselves (I need someone else to help me, like a therapist or doctor). the whole thing is massively disempowering -- and I suppose I could try to go through with it, but I just prefer not to, at this point. I'm OK being a reflector, and there's no real point to trying to change them or to become some kind of *gold*. I like that I'm the model bad-guy. I'm a terrible terrible very evil person -- but because I feel so good (not cause of conditions, but because of my perception), all of that awfulness comes out. reborn into another different set of circumstances, where I don't have the opprtunity to learn about LOA, I'm the same as the saturnian guys: I feel I need to manipulate conditions to get what I want. I know them as well as I know myself, and the *only* way for me/us to *ever* be a non-terrible person, is to have the conditions or the perception: which is attraction. we're the same, you know. I reflect all of good and all of evil. I am the universe.
