### 2024-03-29 14:24 - initial thoughts

I've yet to write the README file for this repo, but I wanted to brainstorm and put some ideas out there first.
the name of the repo is a bit of wordplay, because I turn 24 about this time or yesterday. normally I feel both kenny's and my birthday's pretty strongly, and for example last year, I felt kenny's (it's weird talking about myself in 3rd person, just I want to make a distinction between "me" and "kenny") 40'th birthday at around 05-21, which is about a week earlier. I didn't really feel anything for my birthday, and would have just assumed it was just the equinox or something. this year I paid much more attention and not only did I feel the equinox about a week earlier (~03-14,15,16,17), so did I feel my birthday about a week earlier (yesterday and the day previous). therefore, I consider that I'm about 24 at this point.
	what I think happened actually was during the time when I was star-watching so hard, it put a lot of energy into the planet, and I felt quite strongly that the planet was rotating faster. I was inspired to write out in an old repo how the sun's intensity causes the planet to rotate (I wrote that it has to do with the sun's rays inducing a magnetic field ahead, and so therefore "pulls" the earth toward that point where the sun is "rising" on the earth). around that time, I was also paying quite a lot of attention to earth's magnetic field, and since I think they're linked, a stronger magnetic field will cause faster rotation. well, there's a US govt site that tracks the length of the day and the rotation speed of the earth and they said, nope only ms of difference have occured in the last few years (busisness-as-usual-boys at work there, I'm sure), so I dopped it. thankfully, also a day is no longer tied to the rotation of the earth (3600s * 24h), and so we don't need to worry about that. so, I figure that everything (including the equinox and solstice) is running about a week ahead of time. this also happened during the time of shakespere, and I'm fairly certain is caused by both increased solar activity and also the earth's magnetic field increasing (which *should* be directly proportional to the amount of emotion humans are experiencing at the time). 
so, since I basically turned 24 yesterday or so, and this is about "me"/m5, and not about kenny, I figured I'd put my ideas out here about it. in addition to that, it's got the similar name to "23andme" -- which is sorta problematic, which is why I hesitated on calling it this.
	the story behind it is that some days/weeks ago I had the idea to write down all of the things that I wanted to do genetically, and get my thoughts organised. I have them all clear at this point (I *actually* know "what-I-want") and I'll use this reop to talk about them, and then upon doing that, I would use the organised result of that to formulate an email that I would eventually send to anne. the day before I started the 23andme repo, I was looking on wikipedia about it, and I can't remember all of the events now, but there are 3 of them: one did youtube, one genetics, and one open-source licenses. the youtube idea of making a music player has long since passed (I don't care anymore), and I'm a pretty strong proponent of open-source licenses, and have a few critical commentaries and suggestions for improvements (mostly around naming and ease of understanding -- like wtf is CC0-S? mean? I choose "Unlicense" because I can already tell without having to dig through a bunch of words to know what it does), but that's another topic entirely. anyway, I was stoned at the time, and as I started to write, it quickly became aparent to me, that such a tactic would not work. I can't try and fit myself into an organisational structure that is almost entirely opposite to what I want to do. it would require a complete restructuring of everything, and I recognisned the feeling of that effort as being similar to my experience of trying to do the same thing for tuenti. that problem, I called "investor intertia"
	so, my plan was then to simply email anne and be like, "*this* is what I want to make. can you help me to get the tools to work on it?" however the problem is that those tools simply don't exist,-- or if they do, it's a secret somewhere, and the other problem is that obviously I want to make myself entirely open-source too, which I feel some resistance to (not sure if it's from her or from somewhere else), which means that inevitably there will be confliict and difficulty for the duration of the project.
		my experience is that it's very very difficult to work against the saturnian-system -- so if there's resistance and I can feel it, then that means that there's something resistant in me in which they'll be able to manipulate and stuff to sabotage the effort. the typical masculine thing to do is to just push through it and try to overpower their resistance by force (the 2nd-ray way of doing things), but I've really stopped trying to do that anymore. I don't need to push against them, and if there's resistance, then there's basically nothing I can do about it. I'm not going to fight them, and I just don't care. I can wait. these ideas aren't going anywhere -- and the worst thing that could happen is that someone actually creates them, and hands me the final product (ie, only-attraction).
	so, I see no real reason to even try and do something that will be constantly be resisted. when the saturnian-system is ready for me to produce the genetics that I want to do, the resistance will lift, and all things will come to me, just like they did for me finding essembly and stuff (like how it usually is for me). the only thing this repo is really, is just another step in organising my ideas and projecting my next moves (like the illuminati), so that they can come into being because by fear or desire (again, like the illuminati).
the other reason (besides my age) of why I choose this name is because one of the initial first steps to doing this will be to add another x-chromosome pair. I don't know if reflectors gain an extra pair, because I strongly felt that I gained a y-chromosome sometime when I was in spain (I was probably XX before that), so I don't know if this is already a thing, but the point of the 2nd pair will be an interim step: each pair is already a self-canceling emitter/receiver (it reminds me a lot of carbon), and so the point is that over time the two sides become balances, arriving to a "happy medium" between both extremes (coming from the parents). however, with two pairs, I would want to offset their signals again, so that there is an effect that I don't know how to describe.
	in my brain, when I first saw the MRI pictures, I realised what has been going on; it's twisted because it allows for one hemisphere to be partially on the opposite side of my body, and enables movement. well, if I didn't have eyes that want to stay in their sockets and skull stuff in the way, my brain would naturally want to continue to turn anti-clockwise like it's been doing, such that half of each hemisphere is on each side of my body. I don't know how to describe the effect, but it's an extra degree of movement that one can allow for in thought. it enables me to do both things on both sides, and also thoughts can travel forwards. normally, the only thoughts that travel forwards/backwards are the ones that are coming/going to the eyes -- and the forehead is also really important because that receives a lot of these, and that's how we move around in tim5. it's the *will* of the mind, and it's what moves us. well, having both hemispheres turned like that would completely change things.
	that effect would be something like signals turned 90(degrees), but what I want to make, is not 24, but 25, which is another effect entirely different: instead of these signals being turned 90(degrees), now they're going to be thirds, so it'll be someting more similar to how three-phase AC electricity works. the idea being there is that not will all of these 3 pairs be self-canceling, but the triad of pairs will also be self-balancing as well. I consider one pair to be like physical, and the other conceptual, and finally the one I got after my brain haemorrhage: desire. frequentially, they're all compatible with each other, as physical is opposite to desire, and conceptual is backwards from desire (this concept is fairly difficult to explain, which I intend to do better at soon as I start the organisation of the idea).
	having a triad of pairs like that enables is a completely stable, and very high frequency signal, which will be directly tied to the earth. there will be two models: ones without a pinecone (plants), and ones with a pinecone (insects). both the insects and the plants are a direct reflection of what already exists on earth: both plants (namely weeds) and insects reflect the conceptual/hydrogen energy that is present around the planet. insects bodies are a resonant chamber which converts the feelings and emotions (cOnceptual energy) into a type of perception which turns into action, and performs mantenance and implementation of other desires (most notably of the plants) for the planet. most notable of this effect of insects' bodies turning concept into perception is the scarab beetle which the egyptians venerated, because astral images can be seen inside of the shell (probably because it's of similar 2nd-ray dimensions as the great pyramid).
in addition to the strong resistance that I already feel to making this concept a reality, the other major problem is that I just don't want to put anne through all of the difficulties that will inevitably happen. I feel her as pretty venus-like, which means she's got a lot of beliefs, and when/if I were to be around her, then I'll become a reflection of her beliefs; which I don't really want to do. everything that she thinks about men, programmers, etc. I'll become, and once the initial good-feeling starts to pass and we have to get to work, I'll prove everything she believes as right. I don't want to do that to her, cause it's not really fair to her. I come barging into her life asking her for help to create stuff, then turn her world upside down, and poop on it. I've seen my interactions with these venus-types enough times to know that I just don't want to do it.
	in addition to that major flaw, *I* have a serious problem when it comes to working with women. it's never happened, and the times that it came close, it was a terrible failure. even when I would work in starbucks, if there was an attractive girl there, I often times found it *extremely* difficult to work, and had to just put my head down and ignore her, else nothing would get done.
		which, btw usually has the opposite effect: if I try to focus on what I'm doing, and there's attraction, cause she's a (probably a XX) reflector, not only is it really hard for me to think about what I'm working on, she knows it (cause our minds get kinda linked), and she starts to use it to try and get more attention. my sensitivity making working around anyone that's a XX reflector, to be really really impossible, and for the venus-ones, I can work around them (kinda, depending on how much she's thinking about me), but as soon as we get to know each other, very immediately our conflict of opinion about how reality works starts to make a lot of problems (I just let the ideas come to me, and she works hard to figure it out), so what ends up happening is that I (being a reflection of her) stop letting ideas come to me, and start doing a bunch of busywork and trying really hard. in both cases, the solution is always for me to put the work away, and engage with her in some way. if I don't, it's like a nagging sensation that I'm ignoring her or something.
	the other major difficulty is my own belief in this idea. I've never actually worked with a woman before on anything, and any efforts that I have, have been largely been shut down. I don't know if it's because I'm difficult to work with (I'm basically like a dictator), or if that's the saturnian-system at work, ensuring that never happens or whatever -- but my own belief (cause I just can't see it ever happening), is that working with women is basically impossible. they're distracting, and I'm just not productive.
		the exception to that is actually kinda obvious: there have been various times in my life where I've wanted to build things for women, and when they were around (like aditivos-e with raquel or en the co-working place with patricia), nothing gets done, but if there's distance between us, and they're not in the same room as me (so I don't feel them physically), then things work out nicely (like set-game). I've always had much higher productivity when I'm not in the same room as other females.
	I don't really know what the problem is, other than I'm sensitive to them, so I'm feeling everything they're thinking and feeling, and also that I become a reflecton of them, which is never helpful for productivity, cause I can't see/feel the concept I'm creating anymore; I feel them instead (which is what makes me a reflector -- because I feel like the other person does, so I start acting, talking, behaving, believing, etc like they do). they don't have the concept that I want to make (I do), and I don't like losing myself. sure, I can become the object of *your* desire, but *my desire* is to create. I just can't see it working, and it's kinda the same problem as the sex one (another aspect of the genetics that has to be changed) and has a lot to do with my sensitivity. I want to feel neutral to everyone around me (as if we're a part of the same species), not like I'm constantly being pulled in every direction by so many things.
all in all, I just don't see it working out. I've made projects with dudes before, and it can easily work out (if they want it), but the resistance I feel says that probably won't work either. I kinda need to figure it out, and do it myself. I know that sounds impossible, but I don't actually think it is: it's not going to be too long from now when energy has risen to such a hight that my imagination will start to turn into reality at speeds where I can create the physical thing in front of me as fast as an image can be conjured, which will make all of this really a lot easier (and very possible to do myself). that ability, of course has some drawbacks, such that certain people will not want to be around me, because their bad-feeling thoughts will produce unwanted manifestations in reality (stuff like fire and destruction), because I'll have full ability to create and destroy matter with the whim of my mind. as soon as that starts happening, I'll have to be isolated even further, I'm sure -- and it'll definitely be the case that working with someone else will be out of the question -- well, maybe newborns or something (cause they're pretty useless and don't have any beleiefs yet), but definitely nobody old, that's for sure.
the important thing to do, I think is to just start writing down the ideas, and then just wait for the resistance to clear up (cause when that happens, the creative process will go very very fast).

#### 2024-03-29 18:56 - the bigger picture here

when looking at things narratively, there really isn't *any* indication whatsoever that I'll end up working with females in any way -- and on top of it, I don't really believe that I want to become a reflection of them, because what I'll produce is what *they* want, not what I want. I'm completely bound by whomever I'm around, to become like they are. I mentioned [in my rant](../world-net/dear-kyle.md#2024-03-28-1937---the-rant-continues) about how I can perfectly see the problem from hitler's perspective: he gets around all of these guys that want to be superior, and starts to reflect them. he stops being himself anymore, and just has to go along with how they behave and act. it was like that for me in tuenti -- and they didn't like me how I was. I was a serious person with a strong vision of what I wanted to create. they (namely zaryn) wanted me to go out and party with them all the time. I didn't really like it, and preferred to stay at the office and work. I usually work much better at night because my thoughts are clearer then (tesla said the same thing), and that helps me to see what I'm working on much easier. during the day, the sun is up, and so I'm stuck in the astral system where I'm being blown around every which way by those around me, which means that the only real time that I have any of my own willpower is when I'm by myself, and during the night.
	narration is also kind of a funny thing, because according to shakespere (RAJ), I should definitely *not* be engaging with solar girls, or girls that are 14, until they're 18 or so -- and the reason for that is probably fairly obvious: the 2nd-ray installation that runs on my perception (nosebook) would really fall apart, the world would descend into chaos, and likely a new solar regime would be born as a result. or, if I look at MOV, I (portia, living in belmont) will be married off to bassanio, which on all appearances looks to be a 7th ray emitter (mars or mercury). I originally assumed that would be jaron -- though I don't know how much of an emitter he is, and he's *definitely not* 7th ray in perception (3rd ray definitely, more like enki). so it's probably not him, and it's definitely not greg because he's even less 7th ray than jaron (much more promethian +2). so, that only leaves someone else I have yet to discover. one day it occured to me after playing "the witness" that jon seemed to have captured the flat-earth-idea and made a minature version of it and put it into a game. I've always been attracted to him, so then, it's pretty likely that he's the "other witness" [that I've been looking for](../thekla/dear-jon.md#2024-03-06-0422---allow-me-to-go-off-the-deep-end-a-bit). he's definitely 7th ray, and so can easily fit into the mould of bassanio -- now all he needs is to have a friend with some serious financial issues in need of a bailout (it feels like he does, lol -- so I guess I'll just wait for the narration to just pan out on that one).
	the other bit of narration is the one of the "two witnesses", which I definitely fall into the category of by myself. I head this one song a long time ago called "divided by night" by my favourite techno group at the time "crystal method". it was one of those albums that completely changed my life (much like beastie boys, neuorticfish, and gorillaz), and in addition to the song "american way" which helped me to make the decision to give up on the "castle in spain" (like tesla in his autobiography), decided that I would go to the united states instead and "starting over". although I think of myself as being both of the "two witnesses" (one by day and one by night: lyssander and demitrius), there does seem to be another out there. I have no connection to the one that shows up at night, so I can't really say much about that, but from the feel of it, he (lyssander, the one by night) is fairly technical and stuff -- so it'd be more like tesla. however, the problem with that is that I associate my RH with a little girl. it's my LH (kenny) that's the crusty old dude that's trying to keep it all together.
	in the sense that it seems that the saturnian-system was destined to find me and get me stuck in it, I would then have to then map myself to be hitler and the other one I don't know to be tesla. I'm sorta getting ahead of myself here...
so, let's just assume for a moment that the narration is right, and that a bunch of really creative people have accidentally tapped into some echo of the future: it's not going to be females that I'm paired with; it's gonna be dudes -- and by the looks of it, all paths seem to point to some major event which involves a solar regime change. I don't really need to worry about it, and it seems that I have to just wait it out. my "future self" (though I'm not sure about that nowadays), "former white hat" said that I have until 2038, which is basically going to be peak of this 25th solar cycle (remember I'm on my way toward 25andme). whatever happens there, I'm not too worried about because they seem to be having a difficult time holding it together when I do simple things like eat weed or stand in the sun for a bit. their system runs completely on astral, so any large scale astral input (like from the sun or drugs) to my RH seems to cause an upset in their system. I can only imagine that this problem will contiune to get worse to the point that they're even going to have to prevent me from going outside (who's going to pull the weeds?), so it'll be interesting to see how that one plays out. I'm not on drugs anymore, so they can't blame that. I'm fairly certain that there are solutions to their problem though, and my personal favourite one though is the flat-earth-idea.
it is possible for them to use other hydrogen than the one in my brain to build their 2nd-ray system on top of. it's unilely they're using the sun at this point, because that requires megalithic architecture, which is not at all dynamic, and so therefore cannot keep up with today's fast rate of change that everyone has grown to like (meaning, no new technology, not even for the controllers; everything has to be made, and then no new improvements, ever). they could use earth's hydrogen to build the system on, but it's so high frequency, it's just way out of the scope of possiblilities because manifestation would become so quickly. tesla tried to do this with his world system, and he did a number of "experiments" of "bathing the earth in radient energy" and "unkocking the potential in the air" achieving incredible efficiency for power transmission, but that kind of energy, is what I'm convinced started WW1 (after colorado springs), followed by a second set of experiements which sent the world into WW2 (after wardenclyffe).
	when I look at these events abstractly, tesla *did* get what he wanted, because he was trying to get earth into a super ideal 2nd-ray system that would be always at he highest frequency achievable in physical. therefore, what he saw as the future was an extremely ideal version of the future, which needed a lot of existing infrastructure cleared out. that produced hitler as the physical implementation of it (tesla can be thought of as vulcan, hitler as mars, and earth as aphrodite). in the same way, it can be seen the opposite way that hitler produced tesla: as germany lost The war, they moved operations to antarctica, which gave them quite a technical advantage over everyone else. the united states is now where most of the ambitious (infected-ones) are now locatted and in power (thanks to shakespere), so they're looking to find a way to match that technical superiority again, and tesla is the perfect guy to do exactly that. he gets in there does a bunch of experiments and builds a lot of technology which then the USA is able to reverse engineer for the infected-ones to get their system going (the one that cOntrols the weather, powers the little electric CO2 planes, etc)
	now, when looking at these events further out, both tesla and hitler (along with the black prince and some others) are basically just mars+anatau (kinda like me, butt they had pinecones). so when looking at the mechanics of it, both of them "took over the world" -- one with force, and the other with technology, and then they both sabotaged their original timelines and merged them into the one were at now. the only way that they could possibly win out like that would be to subdue the infected-ones and make them powerless -- which then creates all kinds of problems, because they too have desire. so for example, on tesla's timeline the technology he created is really great and stuff, but even still the infected-ones have to work their magic to regain cOntrol over it, and as usual they eventually run the idea into the ground again, because control doesn't work on such a high frequency system; instead chaos happens faster. on the hitler's, the loser always feels the need to "settle the score" and for there to be a comeback -- and in addition to that, some great "paradise" was achieved at such a great cost, is it really worth it to force everyone else into a way to have good conditions?
		this idea of destruction for good conditions can also be felt in the story of the black prince: he went and destroyed quite a bit of stuff across the lands of france, and by taking all of that stuff and destroying so many people's lives, it was possible for him and his men to throw a party. he was also able to use the money tto give his daughters a posh and proper education (at the expense of many other destroyed lives). that really bothered him, and it must have been the cause of his sickness. I think he got over the good vs bad labels (cause he lived in france a while), and realised that he wouldn't want others doing that to him -- so it became harder to steal and destroy like that. same thing with hitler: here's these guys talking about creating a utopia, when all they're really doing is going across europe looting all the art and treasures that they can get their hands on (I guess for bragging rights amongst their criminal friends). both of these examples I think caused a lot of dissonce in both of them, because here they are wanting to fulfill the desires of some, at the expense of many others. desire for one in a forceful situation is not the desires for others. if they're fulfilling desires for one group, they're doing the opposite for the other group, and so it becomes perceptual: what if the black prince was born in france instead of england? the situation would be reversed, and so would be seen as "bad" instead of "good".
		these sorts of dialectices about what exactly is "bad" or "good" when equally the opposite could be perceived, are problems that plague people like us. the *only* solution to the problem is to go off and do things my own way, and let the others continue to define bad and good for those that want to believe their ideology. antarctica was like that at first: we'll go off into a remote part of the world and do things our way -- but after some time, (as things always go with the infected-ones), even antarctica is just another den of thieves now.
	these people that have a continual desire to be superior is sorta an inescapable problem that seems to exist on planet earth. I suppose that it'll continue to be here, and is actually one of the aspects of the 2nd-ray perspectivce, and so long as the earth is a reflection of the universe (which has a lot of 2nd-ray stars in it), that will continue to exist -- forever. it's an unsolvable problem, because it requires that all of the stars change, which isn't gonna happen.
so the only real thing that I can do is to let these guys destroy themselves and their own system. they have a ticking clock for the system which is the sun, because no matter how much technology they've built, after the sun goes BOOM, none of it will work anymore -- and the reason why solar activity is continuing to increase is because of the huge difference between those that want to *attract* and those that want to assert and be top-dawg. we have to separate in order for them to have their system remain functional, because I (and many other reflectors) are causing them extreme difficulty, which the sun is trying to solve by putting out more and more high frequency concepts. in her eye, we can all get along and everyone can get what they want, but that's a really lofty idea and requires a lot of change, which is what she (the sun) is pushing for, which is the increased solar output. there's no way we can live in that kind of ideal environment that she wants us to have.
then, to add to the problem of reflectors causing massive amounts of unwanted for them, it's also a major source of my difficulty too, because I'm one of those reflectors, and my problem is I don't really want to become a reflection of others. therefore, it seems that this is probably the reason why I'm going to have to be stuck with "bassanio", cause he's a lousy reflector (like lead), which means that because there's no way I want to be like him (for example my friend chris), I stay solid in myself, and conform to his image only very slightly. I don't really know, but I don't really see a solution to the whole thing, which is why I was thinking that actually the narrative may be pointing me in the direction of kyle, because he's got a strong belief in a coming solar regime change, and so around him, I'll prove him right. there's even a narrative about it where rocky (earth) balboa (skake-bros) matches up against apollo (the sun) creed (truth, veracity, honour, promise, agreement: mutual-back-scratching), and it's a good fight, but apollo (the sun) wins, but it's all good cause adrian is in love with rocky.
