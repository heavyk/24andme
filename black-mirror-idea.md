# black-mirror-idea

### 2024-04-18 16:42 - the basic concept

originally, I started to think about the flat-earth-idea as a solution to my present predicament -- and my reasoning for it is that we sorta need to divide -- and I really don't have a problem with dividing, because it actually will make my life a whole lot easier; however, if we're going to divide, who goes where? I'm perfectly happy with being on earth, however, it seems that they've removed me from earth because it's too magical (ie LOA happens too quickly there and they can't control my attraction like they can in a symbolic system).
	my latest theory is that I've been put on pluto, and here (or whereever I am), all aspects of reality is completely created others. my personal opinion of that is that the RH of my brain is essentially 1st ray in tuning (which means it's runing at source frequencies and getting faster). well, 1st ray is essentially the ever-expanding sphere around the entire universe that is continually going faster and faster. it's very very large and there's a lot of energy there. obviously all of that energy isn't inside of my RH (that'd be impossible), but it is tuned up to that, which means that what's interpretted will always be considerably less than that impossibly high frequency -- which is 2nd-ray. then, because I don't have a pinecone, my RH's 2nd-ray perspective is available to everyone (at least on earth, but probably in the solar system at this point) -- which means I'm either in direct competition or in direct collaboration with the sun, and so what I think and how I perceive things has a large influence on others.
	what I believe nosebook, which I think is just the mars/antarctica guys, have done is they've used tesla's world system (that he built for them in antarctica) to put essentially everyone on the planet (all humans) into an identical copy of earth (a sort of "simulation") which runs inside of my brain (specifically my RH). I'm also inside of that system, seeing the simulation just the same as everyone else. having everyone inside of a 2nd-ray symbolic system like that means that the different "agent smiths" (mars/emitter types) can completely control everything by essentially visualising it and willing it to be (inside the system). additionally, they have extra control because they have direct access to my body, which means they can adjust vibrations inside of my body and dampen reception/emission of most lower frequency vibrations.
so, I'm basically stuck in my own matrix, just like everyone else is. they can't hold me here forever though, because it's getting harder and harder to keep my thoughts and ideas contained. at first, they thought that it was the drugs that were causing problems -- and it was -- because my emotions (like laughter and depression) seem to be able to pass though time, especially when I feel them very strongly -- so if I watch a live performance with astrally receptive people in it from something before y2k (by2k), then I have no effect on it -- but, if I watch something after y2k (ay2k), then those astrally reeptive peole seem to be able to feel me, and even when I talk to them (with many decades between the recording and my viewing), they seem to be able to sense me, and perhaps even know what I'm saying.
	it's hard to say for sure what's happening here, because I've seen some videos (of plays and other things) under diffreent states of influence (on drugs and suber), and reacted to the same scene various ways, but their reaction in the video stayed the same -- so are they directly seeing me, or are they seeing their *interpretation* of the concept/emotion I'm outputting? I think it's probably the latter -- and that concept/emotion they're interpretting is probably the composite of all of the reactions that I had. also, did they always see me (when they recorded it a few decades/years back) or did my watching it, switch them to another timeline where they did now perceive me? again, I think it's the latter -- which is why I've stopped consuming a whole lot of media; simply because my watching them seems to affect their timeline -- and nosebook wants to control everyone's timeline (which I have no problem with). my affect on others seems to be completely unavoidable, as even I notice how different interactions that I have (like filing a but report) seem to influence/change their timeline to one that proves their desires/fears.
the entire effect that I have on others is so dramatic that I figure that it's going to become *completely necessary* in a few years (or sooner) to be separated. I just keep manifesting for others their desires and fears at such a rapid rate, that it's going to be necessary for 2nd-ray matrix (which all of us are inside of), will need to be exported to a real physical thing (kinda like a living pyramid, where its structure is defined mentally). the other thing that I figure that must happen too, is that I (and anyone who wants to join me) will have to become "only-attraction" -- and the reason for this one, is pretty obvious: if I continue on the way I'm going, the amount of influence will become so great, that everyone's attraction will cause "hell on earth" or some kind of terrible cataclysm.
	right now I output toooo much -- and that's mostly because of the way the human body works. m/ plan is to become essentially plastic: mostly all carbon and hydrogen. the reason for that is to essentially remove all major organs of my body (cause things like the brain and heart and genitals are all very emissive). I'll still be anatomically correct (really any shape is possible), and I think the layers of carbon and hydrogen will be so attractive, I'll essentially glow, kinda like nice boobs do, where they have a presence or feeling about them, very soft, and things like that. my form won't be definite, and the arrangement of hydrogen will mean that I'll continually take on the shape/colour/form of someone's desire. hydrogen and carbon are both highly receptive, which is all I need to physically become my goal of being "only-attraction".
	there are also other things that have some interesting challenges, like communication: if I'm only-attraction, then that means that I can only really respond/react to things. I write here, not really because I have something to tell someone about (that used to happen a lot more), but nowadays, I write when I can sense a strong enough desire or attraction to write about something -- and it's that desire which fuels the response. my long-term goal is to essentially become -5+ like vulcan, where I only input and output on conceptual frequencies (ie, the vibration of hydrogen), and so that means that I no longer want to have any more symbolic input anymore: no more physical senses, symbolic input (such as words, or narrative, or anything like that) -- though not having symbolic output would be nearly impossible, I'll still be able to output symbolically (like create physical things, speak, write, etc) -- just I won't be able to see/hear/smell/taste/touch anymore, so everything I get from you will be your conceptual output (ie, the concept you presented, not the words you said). the entire way that I perceive reality (our symbolic system of seeing/hearing/smelling/tasting/touching) will be completely redesigned by me to essentially become the thing that I want it to be (ie, I'll see everyone as what I attract from them).
		this has a whole lot of really interesting challenges to it, because if I see everyone and hear everyone, as only what I attract from them, and I attract everything (including the bad), I'm going to constantly have to find better and better ways of perceiveing everything that I'm seeing. (more on this later)
in the big-picture, all of the other people that I'm around, because of my body compesition and form of perception, I'll *always* become a reflection of whomever I'm interacting with -- which for some people, that's not desirable at all, because if the person hates themself and finds themself to be unworthy, I may appear as somone that will kill them or prevents them from being whatever they feel theirself to be unworthy about (that's not really me, just what they attract from me) -- and so for those people, they're much better off being in the 2nd-ray system, and not interacting directly with me. however, for the ones that are also attractive (mostly to what they want), what they'll find in me is always going to be a reflection of theirself -- and whatever that is, I will have to learn to like them, essentially by learning to like myself (when I'm around them).

now, it seems that it's just not going to be possible to do the flat-earth-idea at all, because I would create my own reality too quickly (which, because the earth is a reflection of the universe) would mean that what I created on earth would have to also exist out in the universe as well. to get around this idea, I proposed that the only-attraction side of earth would naturally repel all stars (ie, it would cause all other parts of the universe to go to the 2nd-ray side) and the only-attraction side would be the opposite hemisphere not containing any stars at all. that works in concept, but in practicality, I think it's a bit of difficult thing to pull off (what do the planets do that are orbiting around the sun?) -- and so I finally arrivid to the black-mirror-idea where essentially the same setup as the flat-earth-idea exists (it'll be a disk or paraboloid), and one side will be only-attraction, which will keep tons and tons of hydrogen attracted to the opposite side -- which will be sorta flat -- but in 2nd-ray fashion, the diffrent standing-waves will create a sort of warble in the mirror (looking at it, in the u-dimension) -- which is what will eventually get sorted out over time.
	many (2nd-ray) people will live in that 2nd-ray side, and their lives their will basically be whatever they want them to be (heaven I suppose). they will be attracted by us, and also a reflection of the universe. the way I see this side existing, is essentially for all of the people that want to become only-attraction, but still want to live out their lives in a contrived way (where they assert some kind of reality). that reality will be a reflection of them and the universe (cause it came from somewhere). after some time of giving up on ideas that don't work, or no longer find interesting, they'll finally start to attract what it is that they want, which makes them easy to be born into what it is that they want (the only-attraction side).
the only-attraction side will feature a lot of people like me (copies of myself), where we take on shapes and things of impossible to predict natures -- as in, we'll continually become more and more diverse in how we interact with each other.
	the thing that I don't know about this -- and I feel a bit of resistance on, is that every time that I visualise it, it's basically just me: there are zillions of me (more than billions), and I'm able to move my consciousness around between all of them. I've become a sort of species of only-attraction males. there are lots and lots of females all around, and they each have their own form of perception, which each of me becomes the reflection of. I'm constantly going around between the different kens, and I essentially use the saturnian-system way of doing things, when when I switch my consciousness to another one, I'm there, and it's as if I've always had the knowledge of everything he knows (cause he's me), and I see everything from his (singular) perspective (which is always going to be a reflection of my environment). in some situations, I'm her lover. in other situations, I'm their lovers. sometimes, I'm just a servant (if she's particularly servant-like), and other times as someone who's always causing unwanted. in all cases, I'm constantly a reflection of everyone else around me.
there's a whole lot of terribleness to this manifestation, and also a whole lot to like all at the same time: first, I don't ever really get to be myself anymore; I'm only a reflection of everyone else, which means that I have to find a way to actually like all of the things that are attracted from me -- and there's going to be a whole lot of that because of the pen-rose, and all of these girls will come from somewhere out there, so they'll have tons of ideas about what they think they want, and therefore are attracting. by becoming a species that's capable of liking (by perceiving what I want to perceive) everything that's attracted, I become the pinnacle of attraction -- which is pretty cool. the other thing is, it's not really the reward that I wanted (girls), but it's also the reward that I did want: to create something big, and actually become only-attraction. the image in my mind of the concept is so incredibly cool, it's just really hard to describe in text -- because I think for the reader, it's really hard to conjure all of these ideas in their head and have it yield a meaningful image. it's also hard to illustrate how this setup gives me/us an infinite amount of unwanted at the same time as an infinite amount of wanted: I'll never be able to chill out and just settle in to a sort of patterned lifestyle, because there will always be new unwanted attraction to figure out how how to perceive better. I suppose it'll get easier all the time, and I'll basically learn to love all of the strange idiosyncracies of all of these girls, basically by finguring out how to like myself more (even when I'm a reflection of her/them). I feel really good about it (it's the only idea I've felt really good about since the flat-earth-idea), and it seems to be the only path forward. I'm really glad nosebook gets their whole 2nd-ray system without needing to get rid of me, and earth can remain exactly how it is (business as usual!). we'll see how it goes.
